mputer systems have gone berserk!" The rest
was incoherent.  Soon afterwards, Deimos simply vanished from the sky.
Since then, attempts to establish contact with either moon have been
unsuccessful.
        You and your buddies, the only combat troop for fifty million miles
were sent up pronto to Phobos.  You were ordered to secure the perimeter of
the base while the rest of the team went inside.  For several hours, your
radio picked up the sounds of combat: guns firing, men yelling orders,
screams, bones cracking, then finally silence.  Seems your buddies are dead.
        Things aren't looking too good.  You'll never navigate off the
planet on your own.  Plus, all the heavy weapons have been taken by
the assault team leaving you only with a pistol.  If only you could get your
hands around a plasma rifle or even a shotgun you could take a few down on
your way out.  Whatever killed your buddies deserves a couple of pellets in
the forehead.  Securing your helmet, you exit the landing pod.  Hopefully you
can find more substantial firepower somewhere within the station.  As you
walk through the main entrance of the base, you hear animal-like growls
echoing throughout the distant corridors.  They know you're here.  There's no
turning back now.

CHAPTER [3]: What makes DOOM different from Wolfenstein 3-D?
------------------------------------------------------------

[3-1]: Texture-Mapped Environment
=================================
        DOOM offers the most realistic environment to date on the PC.
Texture-mapping, the process of rendering fully-drawn art and scanned
textures on the walls, floors, and ceilings of an environment, makes the
world much more real, thus bringing the player more into the game experience.
Others have attempted this, but DOOM's texture mapping is fast, accurate,
and seamless.  Texture-mapping the floors and ceilings is a big improvement
over Wolfenstein 3-D.  With their new advanced graphic development
techniques, allowing game art to be generated much faster, id brings
new meaning to "state-of-the-art".

[3-2]: Non-Orthogonal Walls
===========================
        In other games (such as Wolfenstein 3-D), walls were always joined
at ninety degrees to each other, and were always eight feet thick.  DOOM's
walls are at many angles, and of any thickness.  Walls have see-through
areas, like windows.  This allows more natural construction of levels.  If
you can draw it on paper, you can see it in the game.

[3-3]: Light Diminishing/Light Sourcing
=======================================
        Another touch adding realism is light diminishing.  With distance,
your surroundings become enshrouded in darkness.  This makes areas seem huge
and intensifies the experience.  This also creates some amazing effects;
sometimes the lights go out, and you'll have to look for a light switch or
light amplification visors.  Light sourcing allows lamps and lights to
illuminate hallways, explosions to light up areas, and strobe lights to
briefly reveal things near them.  These features make the game
frighteningly real.

[3-4]: Variable Height Floors and Ceilings
==========================================
        Floors and ceilings can be of any height, allowing for stairs, poles,
altars, plus low hallways and high caves-allowing a great variety for rooms
and halls.
        In DOOM, monsters can be shot on levels that are higher or lower than
you are.  All you have to do is aim horizontally, and DOOM will do the rest!

[3-5]: Environment Animation and Morphing
=========================================
        In DOOM, the world reacts to you.  Many surfaces animate.
A glowing wall-plate may change in appearance when you touch it. Radioactive
ooze could seethe and bubble.
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about environment animation
and morphing.  id Software removed information terminals, access stations,
and wall weapon damaging.  DOOM does include "crushing ceilings," however.

[3-6]: Palette Translation
==========================
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about many different
types of palette translation.  Most of the palette translation has been
removed from DOOM.  The only palette translations that are currently
implemented in DOOM are for multi-player mode (other players are in
different colors), invincibility mode and a few other special effects.

[3-7]: Multiple Players
=======================
        Up to four players can play over a local network, or two players
can play by modem or serial link.  DOOM v1.2 supports modem play.
You can see the other player in the environment, communicate with him or her,
and in certain situations you can switch to their view.  This feature, added
to the 3-D realism, makes DOOM a very powerful cooperative game and its
release a landmark event in the software industry.  This is the first game to
really exploit the power of LANs and modems to their full potential.  In
1994, id Software fully expects to be the number one cause of decreased
productivity in businesses around the world.  See Chapter [8] for more
information on multi-playing.

[3-8]: Smooth, Seamless Gameplay
================================
        The environment in DOOM is frightening, but the player can be at
ease when playing.  Much effort has been spent on the development end to
provide the smoothest control on the user end.  And the frame rate (the rate
at which the screen is updated) is high, so you move smoothly from room to
room, turning and acting as you wish, unhampered by the slow jerky motion of
most 3-D games.  On a 386DX, the game runs well, and on a 486/33, the normal
mode frame rate is almost as fast as television.  This allows for the
most important and enjoyable aspect of gameplay: immersion.

*3-9*: New Monsters and Artificial Intelligence
===============================================
        Wolfenstein 3-D is basically made up of a lot of closed rooms.  When
you open a door, the guards get a chance to see you and opening the door
connects your sound area to the revealed room's sound area, so a gunshot will
be heard in both places. Guards in both places will respond to this kind of
action.  In DOOM it's much more complex.  DOOM isn't made up of a bunch of
rooms; it's a cohesive world.  You might blast your shotgun and the sound
could travel through a window or slime-river tunnel to another entirely
different area and alert some monsters.  Then, they'll come looking for
you!  Opening doors, going down stairs, wading through slime, etc.  You are
still able to get the drop on them from behind, just like in Wolfenstein
3-D -- but you have to be sneakier about it.
        There is a huge amount of enemies in DOOM and DOOM II.  Here is a
list:

        FORMER HUMANS (dudes in filth-covered combat suits):  Just a few days
ago, you were probably swapping war stories with one of these guys.  Now it's
time to swap some lead upside their head. They are the weakest of all
enemies.

        FORMER HUMAN SERGEANTS (dudes in black armor, also filthy):  
Same as above, but much meaner and tougher.  These walking shotguns 
provide you with a few extra holes if you're not careful!

        IMPS (brown thorny hominids):  You thought an imp was cute 
little dude in a red suit with a pitchfork.  Where did these brown 
bastards come from?  They heave balls o' fire down your throat and take 
several bullets to die.  It's time to find a weapon better than that 
pistol if you're going to face more than one of these S.O.B.s.

        DEMONS (pink horrors, vaguely humanoid):  Sorta like a shaved 
gorilla, except with horns, a big head, lots of teeth, and harder to 
kill. Don't get too close or they'll rip your fraggin' head off.

        SPECTRES (vague, half-formed shapes):  Great.  Just what you 
needed.  An invisible (nearly) Demon.

      + LOST SOULS (flying skulls): Dumb.  Tough.  Flies.  On fire.  
Flying skills with a hot temper.  They like to go for a screaming 
head-on collision.

      + CACODEMONS (gigantic floating one-eyed heads):  They float in the
air, belch ball-lightning, and boast one Hell of a big mouth.  You're toast
if you get too close to these monstrosities.

        BARONS OF HELL (you'll know `em when you see `em):  Tough as a dump
truck and nearly as big, these goliaths are the worst thing on two legs since
Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Watch out for the green plasma they fling at you.

      + CYBERDEMON (rocket shooting colossus):  When you get to the end of
the second episode of DOOM, you'll know.  Get ready to see this guy a 
lot more often in DOOM II.

      + SPIDER MASTERMIND (huge robotic chaingun shooting spider):  It 
will make you wish you never were playing DOOM in the first place.  
Watch for it at the end of the third episode of DOOM, and numerous times 
in DOOM II.

      # HEAVY WEAPON DUDE (overweight sergeants with chain guns):  These
guys are probably the first new enemy you will encounter in DOOM II. 
They are more disgusting looking that sergeants, and are also more 
deadly due to their chain gun.

      # HELL KNIGHT (brown colored Baron of Hell):  Slightly easier to 
kill than our friend the Baron, but appear in larger numbers.

      # ARACHNOTRON (toddler version of the Spider Mastermind):  Smaller 
than the Spider Mastermind, and a lot harder to kill, but there are a 
lot more of these guys.  Watch for its BFG9000-like green plasma.

      # PAIN ELEMENTAL (even more disgusting huge Cacodemon-like blobs):  
Watch out for these guys, they fly around and fire Lost Souls at you.  
If you don't kill them quick enough, the Lost Souls will eat you for 
lunch.

      # REVENANT (skeletons with a bad temper):  These huge skeletons 
are just cruel.  They punch and kick the life out of you, and also enjoy 
launching flaming rockets into your torso.

      # MANCUBUS (overweight walking blob with guns for arms):  He is 
fat, ugly, and like shooting enormous fireballs into you from his arms.

      # ARCH VILE (flaming spirits):  Not only does he summon the fire 
elementals to watch you go up in flames, he revives already dead demons 
while he's at it.

+:  Not found in the shareware version of DOOM
#:  Only found in DOOM II


*3-10*: Weapons
===============
        Here's a list of weapons that are in DOOM.  Don't try using these at
home. :)

        (1) Fist
        (2) Chain Saw
        (3) Pistol
        (4) Shotgun
      # (5) Super Shotgun (double barreled)
        (6) Chain Gun
        (7) Rocket Launcher
      + (8) Plasma Rifle
      + (9) BFG9000

+: Denotes a weapon not implemented in the shareware version.
#: Denotes a weapons found only in DOOM II.

[3-10-1]: What does BFG9000 stand for?
--------------------------------------
        Being the most powerful weapon, the only thing BFG9000 could stand
for would be "Big Fraggin' Gun." :)

------------------------------
CHAPTER [4]: Who created DOOM?
------------------------------

        DOOM was created by id Software, and is also published by
id Software.
        Id Software is made up of the following dedicated people:

        - John Romero     Coder         -
        - John Carmack    Coder         -
        - Dave Taylor     Coder         -
        - Adrian Carmack  Artist        -
        - Kevin Cloud     Artist        -
        - Jay Wilbur      CEO           -
        - Sandy Peterson  Designer      -
        - Shawn Green     Tech Support  -
        - American McGee  Tech Support  -
        - Robert Prince   Music         -

Note:  Apogee has NOTHING to do with DOOM.

[4-1]: How can I contact id Software?
=====================================
        id Software can be contacted via the Internet.  If you would like to
ask any questions about DOOM (that are not answered in here), send E-mail to
"help@idsoftware.com".  Id Software can also be reached at their 800 number.
The number is (800)-ID-GAMES.  This number is for ordering games ONLY.  This
number is not for technical support or inquiries.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]: What are the differences between the different releases of DOOM?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

(5-1): What is the shareware release?
=====================================
        The shareware version of DOOM only includes one of the three
missions of DOOM.  Each mission contains eight levels and a secret
level.  The shareware version contains network support and modem
support.  The shareware version does NOT include the Plasma Rifle and
the BFG9000 weapons. On December 10th, 1993, v1.0 was released.  On
December 16th, 1993, v1.1 was released.  On February 17th, 1994, id
released v1.2 of DOOM.  This version fixed many bugs and added new
features, including modem support. Unfortunately, this revision added
many new bugs.  On June 28th, 1994, v1.4 was released.  This version was
only an "Internet Beta version," as was used to find bugs before the
pending released of v1.5 of DOOM.  Then, on July 8th, 1994, v1.5 was
released as another "Internet Beta version."  Both version 1.4 and 1.5
were released without registered version patches. In early August, v1.6
was released as yet another "Internet Beta version." FINALLY! In early
September of 1994, v1.666 made its debut!  The new features of v1.4,
v1.5, and v1.666 are all outlined in Chapter [5-3].

[5-2]: What is the mail-order release?
======================================
        The mail-order release of DOOM includes all three missions of DOOM.
Each mission contains eight levels and a secret level.  This version includes
all weapons.  All mail-order releases ordered July of 1994 are older
versions.  It is recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 if you wish modem
support, Nightmare mode, DeathMatch v2.0, and various other bug fixes.

[5-3]: What makes the six versions different?
=============================================
        Seven different versions of DOOM have been released: v1.0 (which
has the v0.99 operating system), v1.1, v1.2, v1.4, v1.5, v1.6, and
v1.666.  Version 1.0 was the initial December 10th, 1993 release.
Version 1.1 was the first upgrade of DOOM, released on December 16th,
1993.  Although this version fixed many bugs and compatibility problems,
it introduced many new ones. Version 1.2, released on February 17th,
added modem play, Nightmare mode, and better use of networks, but again
introduced many new bugs.  v1.4 of DOOM was a Beta version released
exclusively on the Internet, and was only used for finding bugs before
the pending v1.5 release.  v1.5 followed, which again was released as an
Internet Beta version to find bugs for the pending v1.6.  v1.6 was then
released as another Beta, and finally v1.666 was released in early
September which fixed some modem play problems and other miscellaneous
sound code and control bugs.
        Note: id reports that v1.8 of DOOM will be released in the near 
future, and DOOM II has a version v1.7 and v1.7a.

        v1.4/v1.5/v1.666 new features:

        - New 14.4k and 28.8k modem support
        - Better serial support
        - New and improved SETUP.EXE with the following features:
                + Phone number list
                + Modem string database
                + Level warp key (F1)
                + Up to eight digital channels instead of four
        - New DeathMatch v2.0 rules (-ALTDEATH parameter):
                + All objects respawn after 30 seconds
                + Suicide subtracts a frag from your score
                + Negative frags are now possible
        - You can type "+" and "-" in chat mode
        - The "Official" DOOM FAQ is now included
        - Microscopic map bugs fixed and some elements changed in certain
          maps for network play
        - Recording multiplayer demos is now possible
        - Recorded demos do NOT end when you die or when the level ends.
          You must press "Q" or quit from DOOM to halt recording.  The
          default demo buffer is 128K, but it can be increased by using
          the "-MAXDEMO <#k>" command-line parameter.  "-MAXDEMO 1024"
          would allocate one megabyte for a demo recording buffer!
        - When playing back Multiplayer demos, you can use F12 and TAB
          keys to access the other player's views and watch everyone
          on the automap.
        - You can NOT use external files with the shareware version any
          longer.  You must register first.
        - You can now reload maps using the IDCLEV<e#><m#> cheat if you are
          map editing on a LAN
        - Supports RESPONSE files for up to 100 command-line arguments.  A
          response file is a text file that contains all the command-line
          arguments you which to pass to DOOM.  An example would be:

            ---- start of file ---- (don't type this line)
            -nomonsters
            -deathmatch
            -altdeath

            ---- end of file ---- (don't type this line)
          If you name this file RESPONSE.TXT, when you invoke DOOM, you
          would type "DOOM @RESPONSE.TXT" and add any additional
          command-line parameters afterwards.
        - Sound Blaster AWE32 sound support
        - Sound does NOT work under Windows or OS/2 yet.  A new version is
          being test and will be released when it is stable.
        - new FAST parameter allows optional fast enemies
        - new TURBO parameter allows the marine to move more quickly
          (this is considered cheating and is only meant for DeathMatch play)
        - the DEVPARM parameter is no longer needed to record demos

        NOTE: Saved games from versions before v1.666 do not work with v1.666.

        Bug fixes since v1.5:

        - Miscellaneous sound code, serial code, and control fixes
        - IDKFA and shotgun no longer crashes the game

        Bug fixes since v1.4:

        - SERSETUP has been rewritten-- AGAIN!
        - Help screen now mentions F11:Gamma Correction.
        - Sprite graphics can now be used in PWADs.
        - A bug that caused some monsters to teleport outside of the levels
          has been corrected.
        - Mysterious DeathMatch bug (since v1.0) that caused random objects
          to reappear but not be gettable has been corrected.
        - Increased 64K of savegame buffer space for PWAD developers.
        - SERSETUP COM port setting > 38400 has been fixed.
        - Response file bug fixed.
        - SETUP lets you type ENTER for a control key.
        - New GUS instrumnet mapping file for 1mb GUS cards only.

        Bug fixes since v1.2:

        - Now more than two people can play over a network without crashes.
        - No more PS/2 mouse bug (player loses control of character,
          character spins, game locks, etc.)
        - Saving a game under a open door, restoring it, then pressing
          space no longer causes the game to crash.
        - Sound code rewritten.
        - Serial game difficulty selection fixed in SETUP.EXE.
        - map bug fixes including two-sided linedef bug and faulty
          SKY1 ceiling texture mapping
        - gun projectiles (rockets, plasma, rockets) will no longer trigger
          linedefs

        It is recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 if you have not already
done so.

(5-4): What is the commercial release?
======================================
        The commercial version of DOOM is called "DOOM II: Hell on
Earth" and is now available in stores!
        DOOM II is finished and is now available to registered users of
the original DOOM.  It can be ordered directly from id or from GT
Interactive Software at 1-800-332-4300.  It costs $44.95 per copy.
        DOOM II includes these features:

        * 30 levels plus 2 secret levels
        * Lots of graphics
        * All new music
        * More sound effects
        * Runs a little faster than original DOOM due to further code
          optimizations!
        * New enemies
        * Totally killer DeathMatch-designed levels!

[5-5]: I bought DOOM in a store, is it illegal?
===============================================

        Here is accurate information regarding DOOM's legality.

        (1) DOOM purchased directly from (800)-ID-GAMES is NOT illegal.
        (2) The registered version of DOOM purchased in ANY retail stores
within the United States is illegal.
        (3) The registered version of DOOM purchased on CD-ROM ANYWHERE
is illegal.
        (4) The registered version of DOOM purchased in retail stores
OUTSIDE of the countries listed below is illegal.

                Australia
                New Zealand
                Hong Kong
                Taiwan
                Singapore
                Netherlands
                UK

        (5) The registered version of DOOM purchased in retail stores in
Canada is illegal.
        (6) The shareware version of DOOM purchased anywhere (on CD-ROM

date of purchase, and price.  Calling (800)-388-PIR8 is also allowable
for people without Internet access.

        None of this information applies to DOOM II, which is sold in 
stores.

(5-6): What is WinDOOM?
=======================

        Here is the latest information on WinDOOM, direct from Microsoft.

- WinDOOM is a joint effort of id Software and Microsoft.  Microsoft is doing
  most of the porting work.
- WinDOOM is a Win32 application.  It runs under Windows NT and Windows 4.0.
- WinDOOM uses the recently announced WinG libraries.
- WinDOOM supports full music and sound and supports all Windows MIDI and
  WAVE devices.
- WinDOOM has variable resolution.  WinDOOM can render the display at
  320x200 through 640x400.  Resolutions greater than 640x400 are
  performed via "stretching" (this is a limitation of the DOOM engine)
- WinDOOM supports network play via WinSOCK (TCP/IP) and NetBIOS (NetBeui,
  IPX, etc.)
- WinDOOM supports any display with at least 256 colors.
- WinDOOM is multithreaded so if you're running under a multiprocessor
  machine you'll see a significant speed increase.
- WinDOOM will support DEC Alpha and MIPS RISC machines.

*5-7*: What other DOOM ports are in the works?
==============================================
        Here is the status on all the latest DOOM ports.  This is DIRECT 
from id Software, opinions conveyed in here are not nessecarily the 
opinions of Hank Leukart.

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:


  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM
  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file
  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other
  details


OS/2: Still working, no dates yet. IBM guys are handling this.
This is how this will work: You will be able to download the
OS/2 version from most BBSs and ftp sites. It will work with
your registered wad or the shareware one. NO CHANGE. STILL NO CHANGE.

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

LINUX: the linux version is at sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming
and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

JAG: It's out now. Go buy it. Everyone likes it.

MAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date.
We just got some Power PCs to test the beta
version on. It should be here soon. Please do NOT ask to test
this. There is no more info on this at this time. NO CHANGE.

WINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no
release date. The MICROSOFT guys are working on this. NO CHANGE.

NEXTSTEP: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There

CHAPTER [6]: Where can I get DOOM and related information?
----------------------------------------------------------

[6-1]: How can I get the shareware release?
===========================================

*6-1-1*: What are the file names?
---------------------------------
        DOOM is released in two formats, a two file 1.44mb format, and a 
one file 2mb format.  The 2mb format is released under the name 
"dm1666.zip".  The 1.44mb file names are "dm1666a.zip" and 
"dm1666b.zip." If you got DOOM before September of 1994, it is 
recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 if you wish all of its new 
features and bug fixes. A patch under the file name "dm1666sp.zip" is 
available to upgrade the v1.2 shareware version to v1.666.  A patch 
under the file name "dm1666rp.zip" is available to upgrade the 
registered version to v1.666.  Additionally, a file named "altdoom1.zip" 
is available for those people whose computers do not work with the DOOM 
DOS Extenders, but only for DOOM v1.1. NOTE: Registered version patches 
for v1.4, v1.5, and v1.6bt were NEVER released.
        There is NO shareware version of DOOM II, however, there are 
patches to upgrade DOOM II to v1.7a.  These are available under the file 
names "doom2p16.zip" (if your DOOM II is v1.666) and "doom2p17.zip" (if 
your DOOM II is v1.7).

----------------------------------------
CHAPTER [7]: What is needed to run DOOM?
----------------------------------------

*7-1*: What is REQUIRED to run DOOM?
====================================
        DOOM requires a 386sx IBM compatible computer running MS-DOS v3.3 or
higher, VGA (320x200x256) graphics, and 4mb of RAM.  The shareware version of
DOOM needs about 4.8mb of hard drive space.  The mail-order version needs
about 12mb of hard drive space.
        DOOM II requires a 486 with at least 17mb of hard drive space.  
I have seen it RUN on a 386, but it runs too slow.
        DOOM ports for the Atari Jaguar, Linux/X, Irix/X, Windows, OS/2 PM,
MacOS, SEGA 32X (Mars), QNX, FreeBSD, Solaris, and UNIX are also planned.

*7-2*: What sound cards does DOOM support?
=========================================
        DOOM supports general MIDI, Adlib, Sound Blaster, Sound Blaster Pro,
Sound Blaster 16, Roland Sound Canvas, Gravis UltraSound, WaveBlaster, Pro
Audio Spectrum 16, Sound Blaster AWE-32, and compatibles.

[7-3]: What game controllers does DOOM support?
===============================================
        DOOM supports keyboard, mouse, joystick, and trackball (functioning
as a mouse).
        DOOM also supports the Gravis Gamepad and Logitech Cyberman.

----------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [8]: How can I use multiple players in DOOM?
----------------------------------------------------

        DOOM supports 2-4 players in a multi-player mode. DOOM is
playable over networks, modems and by serial link.

Note: For playing the registered DOOM over networks or by modem, EACH user
      MUST BUY his/her own individual copy of the game.

[8-1]: How does the multi-player gameplay work?
===============================================
        In DOOM, players are able to see each other, and watch each other
jerk in pain as they are hit during the game.  Players are able to watch
others get hurt, die, and move throughout the labyrinth.  DOOM allows
players to play together, working as a team.  In this cooperative mode,
players can see each other on an "automap" and switch to each other's view.
DOOM also allows players to play against each other, in DeathMatch mode.

[8-1-1]: How does pausing, saving, and loading work?
====================================================
        In DOOM, some things change when playing with more than one player.
        When you activate the Options menu or submenus, the game KEEPS
RUNNING so that other players can continue with the action.  So, it is best
to find a safe place before adjusting screen size, sound, etc.
        A player may pause the game by pressing the PAUSE key, but any other
player can unpause the game by pressing the PAUSE key again.  Make sure it is
okay with your buddies before taking a breather.
        When you do a save game during network/modem play, it saves on every
player's system in the save game slot you select, writing over whatever was
there.  Before saving the game, players should agree on a safe slot to save
it in.
        You cannot load a saved game while playing a multi-player game. To
load a game, everyone must quit from the current game and restart the game
from a saved game.  To start a game from a saved game, you can either
select it from the SETUP program or identify it as a command line parameter.

[8-1-2]: What are the different uniform colors for?
---------------------------------------------------
        In network/modem games, each player's uniform is a different color.
The color of your character is the color behind your face on the status bar.
The colors are BROWN, INDIGO (black), GREEN, and RED.
        These are used to identify between players during game play, and
to chat with others using Chat Mode.

[8-1-3]: How does a player see what others are doing?
-----------------------------------------------------
        If you're playing in cooperative mode, press F12 to toggle through
the other players' viewpoint(s).  You still retain your own status bar at
the bottom, and if your view reddens from pain it is YOU, not your partner,
who has been hit.

[8-1-4]: How do players communicate using Chat Mode?
----------------------------------------------------
        In a multi-player game you can communicate with other players in the
Chat Mode.  To enter into Chat Mode and broadcast a message to all the other
players, press the letter "T".  A cursor will appear where your messaging is
normally placed.  To broadcast to a specific player, instead of pressing
"T", you'll need to press the first letter of the player's color: (B)rown,
(I)ndigo, (G)reen, and (R)ed.  For example, to send a message to the brown
character, you would press the letter "B".
        In DOOM v1.2, a macro capability was added.  After defining
ten macros in SETUP.EXE, pressing the player color, and then
"ALT-<macro number>" will send a macro.

[8-1-5]: How do the weapons work?
---------------------------------
        When a player runs over a weapon, he picks it up, but the weapon
remains in the game for other players to take.  Shotguns dropped by former
human sergeants are removed from the game after being picked up or smashed.
        In DeathMatch v2.0 (use the ALTDEATH parameter), weapons are
removed from the playing field from thirty seconds and then reappear when
playing DeathMatch mode.

[8-1-6]: What happens when a player dies?
-----------------------------------------
        If you die and restart in the level, previously taken items and
destroyed monsters don't reappear unless you are playing in DeathMatch
v2.0.  Even though you've died, other players have survived.

[8-1-7]: Can players exchange supplies?
---------------------------------------
        Players cannot exchange supplies.

[8-1-8]: Miscellaneous
----------------------
        In Cooperative mode, each player begins in the same area.  In
DeathMatch mode the players begin in completely different areas--if you want
to see your buddy you'll need to hunt him down.  Plus, each time you die,
you'll start in one of several random locations.
        Unlike in single-player or Cooperative mode gameplay, in DeathMatch
mode the players start at each location with the keys necessary for opening
any locked door in that area.
        In DeathMatch mode the ARMS section on the status bar is replaced
with "FRAG."  The FRAG section displays the number of times you've killed
your opponents.
        In Cooperative mode the Automap works the same way it does in
single-player mode.  Each player is represented by a different color arrow.
In DeathMatch mode you won't receive the pleasure of seeing your opponents on
the map.  Just like the monsters, your friends could be just around the
corner, and you won't know it until you face them.

[8-2]: What exactly is "DeathMatch" mode?
=========================================
        DOOM has a "DeathMatch" mode where every player is out for
himself.  At the beginning, the level is infested with enemies and power-ups.
In this mode, players can't see the other players in the Automap, nor switch
to their view.  Players are not able to view other's health in the mode,
because of the disadvantage this can cause.

[8-3]: How does DOOM work with networks?
========================================
        DOOM supports the IPX (Novell Netware) protocol in the initial
shareware version.  Using this network support, DOOM can be played in a
workplace type environment.
        To start network mode:
        (1) Launch DOOM from the SETUP program, by going to the directory in
which you installed DOOM, typing SETUP, and pressing the ENTER key. Unlike
playing DOOM in single player mode, DOOM in multi-player mode must be run
either from the SETUP program or by using the command line parameters.
        (2) The SETUP program allows you to configure the information that
is necessary for the multi-player game. The SETUP is simple to use.
        (3) Start the game!

(8-3-1): What are the network command line parameters for DOOM?
---------------------------------------------------------------
-LOADGAME allows you to start DOOM from a specified save game.  Instead of
using the saved game name, simply enter the number (0-5) that corresponds to
the slot you saved the game to on the SAVE GAME screen.
-loadgame <# of the game>

-DEATHMATCH starts DOOM as a DeathMatch game.  If you don't enter DEATHMATCH
as a command line parameter, DOOM will default to Cooperative mode.
-deathmatch

-SKILL sets the skill level (1-5) you wish to play.
-skill <# of skill level>

-EPISODE sets the episode (1-3) you wish to play.  The default episode is
Episode One, Knee-Deep in the Dead.
-episode <# of the episode>

-CONFIG allows you to use your configuration file from any directory you
choose.
-config <pathname> ex. -config f:\doom\data\myconfig.cfg

-NOMONSTERS allows you to start playing with NO MONSTERS running around!
This is great for DeathMatch where, really, the monsters just get in the
way.
-nomonsters

-RESPAWN tells DOOM that, yes, you are a badass, and yes, you want all the
monsters to respawn 8 seconds after you kill them.  The NIGHTMARE skill
level already does this.  Note that using -respawn and -nomonsters at the
same time is a dumb thing to do.
-respawn

-ALTDEATH uses DeathMatch v2.0 mode.
-altdeath

-FAST uses fast monsters, as in Nightmare mode
-fast

-MAXDEMO determines the maximum size of a recorded demo
-maxdemo <size in K>


-TURBO increases the speed of the marine (this is considered cheating in
single player mode and is meant for DeathMatch only)
-turbo <speed increase 1-255>

[8-3-2]: How does DOOM determine player colors?
-----------------------------------------------
        The player numbers and colors are determined by the ethernet node
address. The lower the number, the lower number you will be assigned in a
multi-player game.   The lowest number gets green, and the highest number
(with four players) gets red.  To change the player numbers in a net game,
insert the line :"NODE ADDRESS xxxxxxxxxxxx" under the Link Driver section of
your net.cfg before you load LSL.

[8-3-3]: How can I use DOOM on Novell Netware Lite?
---------------------------------------------------
        Hwere is information on how to play DOOM on a Novell Netware Lite
network.  Novell does not approve of or recommend the following drivers.

HOST/CLIENT (1) Load the LSL.  (LSL.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (2) Load your card driver.  (example: 3C5X9.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (3) Load your server.  (SERVER.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (4) Load your client.  (CLIENT.COM)
CLIENT      (5) Log into the network.
CLIENT      (6) Map the hosts to the hard drive.  (refer to NWL Manual)
HOST        (7) Run DOOM's SETUP.EXE, configure, and press F10.
CLIENT      (8) Change to mapped DOOM directory, and run SETUP.EXE,
                using the same options as used on the host.
            (9) PLAY DOOM!

Note: It is illegal to use the Registered DOOM on only one server.  You
      must buy a seperate copy of the game for each player.

[8-3-4]: How can I use DOOM on other types of networks?
-------------------------------------------------------
        It does not matter what type of network you use for DOOM, whether it
is Lantastic, Windows for Workgroups or other networks.  netDOOM uses the
cards at such a low level that it does not need the network services.  It
only needs the ODI/IPX drivers.
        This being the case, netDOOM works fine with any Ethernet or any
other cabling system. Naturally, you can not use any normal network services
at the same time.

        There are a number of ways of getting IPX working with a given
ethernet card.  One is to use a dedicated IPX driver for the card,
another is to run an IPX converter over some other standard such as
NDIS, ODI, or the packet driver standard.  If one method fails to
work, try another one!  I have had good reliability with the IPX
over Packet driver method, though it can sometimes be a challenge
to get it running...  If you are already using Novell, then the IPX
over ODI might be simpler to set up, though I have found it less
reliable.

        Before I get going, let me plead with everyone NOT TO USE DOOM 1.1
OR 1.0 ON ANY NETWORK OTHERS ARE TRYING TO USE!!  Doom 1.666 is now
available, so please use it rather than 1.1 or 1.0.  DOOM 1.0 and
1.1 really screw up networks.

Now that I have all my disclaimers out of the way... :)

        To use this method of installing IPX you need two files, both of
which are in the file PKTD11.ZIP, which can be had from
oak.oakland.edu as/pub/msdos/pktdrvr/pktd11.zip.  I have seen some
problems with this version (11) of the drivers, however, so it
would be wise to test out the packet driver after it is loaded, or
perhaps to try one which comes direct from the ethernet card
manufacturer. (i.e. 3c5x9pd.com from ftp.3com.com)

        If you have problems with these drivers, I have put together a
collection of older versions of IPX and packet drivers which seem
to work better with DOOM.  This package will be uploaded to
ftp.uwp.edu as OLDIPX.ZIP.  (see Chapter [14-6])

        The first file is specific to your ethernet hardware.  It is the
packet driver software that converts packet-driver calls to
commands your ethernet card can understand.  The INSTALL.DOC file
included with the packet driver collection has details about which
cards are supported and what sort of command-line parameters are
needed for each packet driver.  I always load the packet driver
using interrupt 0x60, a popular convention.  These drivers will not
work well under Windows without tweaking, so read the INSTALL.DOC
file for details.  There are also some useful packet utilities
included.  Again details are in INSTALL.DOC.  (Got the hint yet? :)

EXAMPLES:

     3Com 503 card on interrupt 5, I/O port 0x300, and the
     internal transceiver. (twisted pair RJ-45 connector ON
     THE CARD or coaxial BNC connector-- NOT the 15-pin AUI
     connector) The shared memory area is automatically
     determined-- but be sure to exclude the region from your
     expanded memory manager, if used!

          3C503.COM 0x60 0x5 0x300 1

     3Com 509 card: These cards are entirely
     software-configurable through the config/diagnostics on
     your EtherDisk that came with the card.  If you have lost
     the disk, all the needed files are available from
     ftp.3com.com.

          3C509.COM 0x60

     AT&T StarLan cards: Almost like the 503 except the memory
     location must be specified.

          AT&T.COM 0x60 0x2 0x360 0xD000

        Once the packet driver is loaded and reports things correctly
(i.e. it does not give your ethernet address as
FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF...) then just run PDIPX.COM to load IPX support.
The PDIPX.COM program is included with PKTD11.ZIP, but it is
contained in a .ZIP file INSIDE of PKTD11.ZIP called PDIPX103.ZIP.
Run the .COM file with no parameters.

        If you have problems with an "invalid mode" when loading PDIPX, you
probably are trying to run other network software at the same time
as the Packet Driver/IPX combination.  Strip down your CONFIG.SYS
and your AUTOEXEC.BAT files to those shown below.  Do not load any
additional TSR's!  Once this bare-bones configuration works, you
can begin adding TSR's.  if your problems persist, try using the
older versions of the packet driver and IPX-to-PD converter.  (They
should be on ftp.uwp.edu.)

        If nothing seems to work, try running the diagnostic program
PKTWATCH.COM after getting everything set up.  If your screen fills
with scrolling multicolor hexadecimal numbers then the packet
driver is working OK.  If it just flashes a cursor at you, then you
have problems UNLESS you are wired directly to another computer.
Hook your computer back up to an active network and see if you can
receive anything then.  If you do not have an active network
available, start DOOM on the OTHER computer while running PKTWATCH
on the original computer.  Of course, the other (sending) computer
needs to have IPX set up as well.

        The simplest way to get all the drivers you need loaded and to
exclude other drivers which may interfere is to create a boot disk
with the correct startup files.  For example:

     CONFIG.SYS
          device=a:\himem.sys
          dos=high,noumb
          files=30
          buffers=30

     AUTOEXEC.BAT
          prompt [DOOM Setup] $p$g
          a:\3c503.com 0x60 0x5 0x300 1
          rem change the above according to your card.
          a:\pdipx.com

        The ONLY line that will vary with what card you have is the
"3c503.com" line.  I encourage you NOT to load an EMS driver since
so many cards use shared memory and it is sometimes difficult to
ensure that the proper area, and only the proper area, is excluded.
DOOM runs just fine with XMS, and you have the added benefit of
loading DOS high to make room for things like mouse drivers.  DOOM
does not NEED XMS to run, though.  Also, I like to change the DOS
prompt to reflect my configuration whenever I am using a bizarre
setup.

        It might be a good idea to also scan your bootable floppy for
viruses BEFORE booting the networked computer with it.  (Scan it on
the NETWORKED computer, not your own...)  There are a number of
common viruses spread by booting computers from infected disks.
(Stoned, Form, and Michelangelo to name a few.)  Let's not give
DOOM a bad name by booting network computers from infected disks!
(btw, F-prot from oak.oakland.edu as /pub/msdos/virus/fp-211.zip is
an EXCELLENT antivirus program. <plug>)

        You must make sure that all of the networked computers using DOOM are
using the same frame type.

[8-3-5]: How can I set up a small inexpensive DOOM network?
-----------------------------------------------------------
        All that is required for network play is a network card for each
computer, a T-plug for each computer (usually supplied with your network
card), and some cable.  A server is not necessary.  Here is a good supply of
inexpensive eight bit network cards for DOOM play.

Corporate Systems Center                PHONE: (408)-734-DISK
1294 Hammerwood Avenue                    FAX: (408)-745-1816
Sunnyvale, CA 94089

        Brand new 16-bit cards priced at only US$49.00 each.  When calling,
tell your service person that you would like to run DOOM.  Corporate Systems
will send you the cards mentioned here.

[8-4]: How can I play DOOM by serial link?
==========================================
         DOOM works in two player mode by modem or null modem.  The
minimum baud rate to play DOOM is 9600 bps.
        Shareware versions 1.0 and 1.1 do NOT support play by modem or
serial link.  It is recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 of DOOM.
        Using this mode is similar to network mode.
        To use a serial link connection, run the DOOM setup and choose "Run
Network/Modem/Serial Game."  Then, choose the type of connection you plan
to make.  Then, configure the game to your liking, and choose the connect
method.
        Note that to run null-modem game, you must have a null-modem cable
plugged into a serial port on both computers and each computer runs
SETUP.EXE with identical parameters.
        If you are using a modem, you will most likely need to edit the
MODEM.CFG file in the DOOM directory.  The first line of the file is an
initialization string.  Pull out your modem manual, and do the following.

        (1) Find the code that turns off error correction.
        (2) Find the code that turns off data compression.
        (3) Find the code that locks your modem at 9600 baud.
        (4) Find the code that turns off all hardware and software flow
            control.
        (5) Create an "AT" initialization string with all these codes and
            put it into the MODEM.CFG.

        To find an already created initialization string for your modem, look
in Chapter [18-3] of this FAQ.  If one is not listed for your modem, you will
have to dig up your modem manual for the correct settings.
        The second line is a hangup string used when you quit DOOM.
        If you STILL cannot get the modems to connect, both of you should
run your favorite terminal programs, and connect with 9600, no error
correction, no data compression, and NO HARDWARE FLOW CONTROL.  Then just run
SETUP.EXE with the "Already Connected" option in the configuration box.

[8-5]: How can I play DOOM over the Internet?
=============================================

(8-5-1): How can I play DOOM using IHHD?
----------------------------------------
        Enter IHHD -- the Internet Head to Head Daemon designed by Jim
Knutson.  With this brilliant little piece of code, multiplayer gaming has
soared to new heights.  With IHHD, you'll be able to play Head to Head
against other human opponents all over the world, with the only cost to you
being the regular prices you pay to connect to or use your Internet host.
Best of all, it's free.

        First of all, your host needs to be running UNIX as its operating
system.  If you aren't sure what your host is running for its operating
system, check the information given at the login prompt or send mail to
your administrator.

        Other than that, you should be able to run IHHD with ease.  Your
first order of business is to get the IHHD software.  It is available via
anonymous FTP at "rex.pfc.mit.edu" in the "pub/IHHD/src" directory.

        To get it:

        (1) FTP to rex.pfc.mit.edu  ("ftp rex.pfc.mit.edu" at UNIX prompt)
        (2) At the login prompt, enter "anonymous"
        (3) At the password prompt, enter your E-mail address
        (4) At the command prompt, type "cd pub/IHHD/src"
        (5) Type "binary"
        (6) Type "get dialer1.6.4.shar"
        (7) Type "bye"

        If you followed the above steps, you should now have the
"dialer1.6.4.shar" file in your home directory.  Type "ls" at your host's
command prompt to verify its existence.  If you don't see it, try the
above steps again or call for help.

        Next, if you've successfully retrieved the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file
from the FTP site, you need to prepare the IHHD to run on your UNIX system.
For UNIX veterans, the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file is in fact a shar file, and
contains a makefile for easy compiling on your system.  For the rest of
us, follow these steps to get the IHHD up and running:

        (1) Create a directory to put the IHHD software in.
            Type "mkdir IHHD" at the command prompt.
        (2) Move the IHHD file to the new directory.
            Type "mv dialer1.6.4.shar IHHD"
        (3) Go to the IHHD directory.
            Type "cd IHHD"
        (4) Unpack the IHHD files.
            Type "sh dialer1.6.4.shar"
        (5) Compile the IHHD software to run on your system.
            Type "make"
        (6) You should now see a whole mess of files in the IHHD directory.
            The important filenames you're looking for should be:
                "dialer"
                "tcpdialer"
                "tcpanswer"
                "call"
                "showlog"
        (7) If you've got these, you're cool.  Otherwise, try the above
            steps again, re-retrieve the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file from
            "rex.fpc.mit.edu" using the instructions above, or call for help.

If everything checks out, you're ready to rumble!

Here's how you get connected using IHHD:

        (1) Set up a time to play with another Internet DOOM player.
            Ideally, you should use E-mail to make the prior arrangements.

            Make sure you and your opponent use the same baud rate and line
            settings for your modems.

            Make sure data compression, error correction, and hardware
            flow control on your modem are off.  Look at the modem
            initialization strings section in this FAQ for more help.

        (2) When it's time to play, start your favorite terminal program
            and call up your Internet host using your modem.  Make sure that
            your baud rate and line settings correspond to your opponent's.

        (3) Login to your Internet host normally.

        (4) Contact the other player by sending a short E-mail message
            indicating that you are on the net and ready to play.

        (5) Once you both establish that you're there and ready to go,
            return to your UNIX prompt.

        (6) Type "cd IHHD" to enter your IHHD directory.

        (7) You may have to type "terminal download," if you do not have it
            activated already.

        (8) Type "dialer opponent's.host" to start the IHHD connection.
            For example, if you were playing against knuston@cactus.org,
            you would type "dialer cactus.org" to initiate the connection.

            Another way is to type "tcpdialer opponent's.host" while your
            opponent types "tcpdialer -answer".  Or reverse roles, where
            you type "tcpdialer -answer" while your opponent types "tcpdialer
            your.host".  Don't ask me what the difference is; I don't know.

            So, to recap, there are two methods of IHHD connection.
            Method 1: dialer.  You each type "dialer other.guy's.host"
            Method 2: tcpdialer.  One of you types "tcpdialer other.guy's.host"
                      while the other types "tcpdialer -answer".

        (9) Regardless of which method you use to connect, type short text
            messages followed by a carriage return until you see your opponent
            acknowledge you.  Unless you have "local echo" set to ON in your
            serial settings, you will not see the text you type.

       (10) If you don't see your opponent after a reasonable amount of time,
            exit dialer or tcpdialer by pressing "CTRL-C" (i.e. hitting
            the "CTRL" and "C" key simultaneously.)  Contact your opponent
            again by E-mail and agree to try the other method of
            connecting.

       (11) If you're connection looks fine and your opponent has acknowledged
            you and you have acknowledged him, exit your terminal program
            and change to your DOOM directory.  Run SETUP.EXE, and select
            "Run Network/Modem/Serial Game."  On the next menu, choose
            "Modem."  Finally, configure all of the options to your liking,
            select "Already Connected," and press F10.

       (12) If everything goes well, DOOM will start up and bring you to
            your first game over the Internet!  Congratulations, you are
            now connected by IHHD.  You can now proceed to play DOOM as if
            you were connected via a regular phone line.

        If you are having trouble getting DOOM to work with your modem, you
may want to download one of the many third-party serial drivers for DOOM.
(see Chapter [15])

        Unfortunately, because of the nature of the Internet, delays and
warping may occur with your IHHD connection, depending on the quality of the
connection between your and your opponent's host machines.  These delays
are often sporadic, and depend largely on what's going on on the Internet
at that particular times.  Then again, you might just be extremely unlucky
and have a cruddy Internet connection.

        To gauge the quality of the connection, try to "ping" your opponent's
computer from your host.  At the UNIX prompt, type "ping -s opponent's.host".
You should get a listing of "ping times", which you may stop at any time by
pressing "CTRL-C".  Try pinging some other hosts you know to get an idea of
how much ping times vary, and use this data to guesstimate the quality of the
connection between your host and your opponent's.

        Another way to judge the quality of your connection is to simply look
at the other player.  If he's jumping all over the place, you've got a
cruddy connection.  If he's relatively smooth and steady, you've got a good
connection.

        If all else fails, burn incense and sacrifice a beautiful young virgin
princess to the net.gods.  No, wait.  Better yet, send me a virgin.  E-mail
me for an address.

*8-5-2*: How can I play DOOM using iDOOM?
-----------------------------------------

                    The TCP/IP Internet DOOMer's FAQ
                    by Scott Coleman (asre@uiuc.edu)
                  and Jay Cotton (jay@calc.vet.uga.edu)
                            updated 10/16/94
                        

Introduction

id Software's DOOM is truly the Killer App of the MS-DOS world.
DOOM's popularity is so immense, it has been estimated that DOOM
is installed on more PCs than OS/2 and Windows NT combined, and
DOOM's creators commute to work in Ferarris. Interest in the game
has been so great that it has been hacked, reverse-engineered,
dissected, and enhanced more than any other game in PC history.
And now, as more and more people become hooked into the Internet,
DOOM is rapidly becoming the Killer App of the Internet, as well.

     Internet DOOM play is currently at the "clever hack" stage.
DOOM, as released by iD, supports only IPX network play and
serial play between two machines. As a result, the DOOM
documentation doesn't include any information about DOOMing
across the Internet. Of course, this also means that DOOMers
can't call id for help. The result of all this is many curious
people asking the same question: How do I play DOOM over the
Internet? Enter this document. In the pages that follow, we will
attempt to answer the most frequently asked questions about
Internet DOOM, including what you need, how to set it up, and how
to find new fragbait - er, I mean, opponents.

     DOOM across the Internet is made possible by a neat little
freeware program called iDOOM. iDOOM uses the UDP protocol (part
of the TCP/IP protocol suite) to send DOOM game information
between multiple machines on the Internet. It is based on the
WATTCP TCP/IP kernel written by Eric Engelke of the University of
Waterloo. By some strange coincidence, the authors of this
document are also the creators of iDOOM, and we have used the
program to play Internet DOOM sessions with opponents from as far
away as Estonia. In writing this FAQ, we hope that sharing some
of our experience will make it easier for you to get connected in
your own Internet DOOM sessions. NOTE: Throughout this document,
we will refer specifically to games of DOOM played over the
Internet via a DIRECT CONNECTION, i.e. no modems are involved
anywhere in the link. Note that IHHD, SLIP and PPP connections
all involve modems at some point. Although other methods of
connecting two DOOM machines together across the Internet exist,
this document will focus on direct net connections using the
iDOOM network driver program.

 Getting Prepared

     Q1: I want to play DOOM over the Internet using iDOOM. What
hardware do I need?

     To successfully play DOOM across the Internet, you will need
the following hardware:

     * A machine capable of playing DOOM (D'OHH!) 

     * A network interface card (NIC). And not just any old NIC,
     mind you - your NIC must be supported by a packet driver if
     you wish to use it to play Internet DOOM. Usually this means
     that your NIC must be an ethernet card, although iDOOM has
     been successfully played over token ring. This document
     assumes that your PC is already equipped with a suitable
     NIC, although it may currently be in use for some other
     non-TCP/IP function (such as a node on a Novell network).

     * A direct connection to the Internet. If there is a modem
     somewhere in the link between your PC and your opponent's
     PC, this FAQ is not for you. Although it is possible to play
     Internet DOOM over a modem link (either by dialing up to a
     UNIX machine and using IHHD or via SLIP/PPP), such
     connection methods are beyond the scope of this document.  
           
     Q2: OK, I've got all the hardware. What software do I need? 
               
     In addition to the hardware requirements, some software is
also required to round out your the package. Before you can play,
you'll need to pick up the following:

     * DOOM 1.2 or higher (1.7 is STRONGLY recommended, since
     this version seems to have solved some problems related to
     network games). DOOM versions 1.1 and below are incapable of
     using iDOOM.

     * A packet driver written specifically for your ethernet
     card. The Packet Driver is what lets iDOOM (and therefore
     DOOM) "talk" to your NIC.

     * iDOOM.EXE, the Internet driver for DOOM.  
     
     * The WATTCP Applications. These are not absolutely
     necessary, but can definitely be useful for debugging and
     testing your setup. 

     Q3: Hold on - I don't have some of this software! Where can
I get it?

     * To obtain iDOOM: Log on to ftp.vet.uga.edu via anonymous
     ftp. Change to directory /pub/doom. Download the file
     IDOOM11.ZIP. Version 1.1 is the latest version of iDOOM as
     of this writing. 

     * Many ethernet cards come with the appropriate packet
     drivers on a utilities diskette packaged with the card. If
     your card does not come with a packet driver, there is an
     excellent collection of freely available packet drivers
     called the Crynwr (nee Clarkson) Packet Driver collection.
     You can obtain it via anonymous ftp from oak.oakland.edu.
     Change to the /pub/msdos/pktdrvr subdirectory and download
     PKTD11.ZIP and PKTD11C.ZIP. The files PKTD11A.ZIP and
     PKTD11B.ZIP contain source code and example programs for the
     packet drivers - you won't need these in order to play
     iDOOM.

     * To obtain the WATTCP applications, ftp to
     dorm.rutgers.edu, change to the /pub/msdos/wattcp/
     subdirectory, and download file APPS.ZIP.
               
     Q4: OK, I've got everything, now what do I do to set it up? 

     Setting your computer up for TCP/IP access is very
straightforward. As an illustration, I'll be taking you through
the steps necessary to set up a PC with an SMC ethernet card and
the IP address 128.192.23.5. You'll of course need to substitute
your own specific information in place of the examples given
here. All set? OK, let's get started.

     Step 0: START WITH A CLEAN BOOT!!!!! Set up your CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load as few drivers as possible. This
includes such things as memory managers (HIMEM, EMM386, QEMM,
etc.) and network drivers (e.g. LSL, IPXODI). DOOM doesn't need
the former, and the latter will probably conflict with the packet
driver. We recommend that you prepare a boot floppy with a
CONFIG.SYS containing only a FILES=20 line, and an AUTOEXEC.BAT
containing only the line "prompt=$p$g".

     Step 1: Set up the packet driver. Determine your ethernet
card's IRQ setting, it's base I/O port setting, and it's memory
address setting (if any). You should be able to determine this by
looking at the card itself and consulting the user manual. You'll
need some if not all of this information, depending upon which
packet driver you use and/or type of hardware you have (for
example, some IBM computers with the MicroChannel bus can
determine the settings on the card automatically without you
having to supply them on the packet driver command line). Unzip
the appropriate driver from Crynwr Packet Driver collection
archive. In our example case, the packet driver is called
SMC_WD.COM. By looking at the jumpers on the card and consulting
the manual, I determined that the card has been set to IRQ 7,
Base I/O port address 300h, and the base memory address is at
segment d800h. For this example, I have chosen to use interrupt
60h for the packet driver. Packet drivers typically operate on an
interrupt in the range of 60h to 80h inclusive; since nothing
else in my sample system happens to be using the first available
interrupt (INT 60h), I chose that. Thus, to load my packet
driver, I use the command line


     SMC_WD 0x60 0x7 0x300 0xd800

where 0x60 is the packet driver interrupt, 0x7 is the IRQ setting
on the card, 0x300 is the I/O port base address, and 0xd800 is
the memory base address (NOTE: all numbers are in C-style HEX
notation). Don't worry if you don't understand what all this
stuff means - as long as you use the correct numbers, your packet
driver should work. NOTE: If your PC is currently part of a
Novell network (e.g. Netware, Netware Lite, Personal Netware) the
parameters you need can be found in a file called NET.CFG,
usually located in your \NOVELL, \NWLITE or \NWCLIENT
subdirectories (along with all the other drivers needed by
Novell). 

     At the very minimum, the packet driver should give a sign on
message and report the ethernet address of your NIC when you load
it. Chances are that if your NIC has been functioning properly
for other tasks (e.g. as a node on a Novell network) then you'll
have no problems here. If not, or if there are any error or
warning messages, something is wrong. One possibility is that one
of the settings on your NIC is in conflict with those of another
expansion card in your system. No two cards can have the same
IRQ, I/O port, or memory address settings, nor can the memory
areas of two cards overlap. Whatever the cause, you'll need to
find and correct the problem before continuing.

     Step 2: Set up your WATTCP.CFG file. Your WATTCP.CFG file
contains important parameters used by the WATTCP TCP/IP kernel.
These values MUST be entered correctly if you wish to make a
connection with another DOOM PC. In preparation for this, you'll
need several bits of information. Contact the network
administrator for your site and find out the IP address for your
machine, the IP address for your gateway or router, the IP
address of at least one Domain Name Server local to your site,
and your netmask value. The three IP addresses will each consist
of four groups of digits separated by periods. In our example,
the machine's IP address is 128.192.23.5, the gateway is
128.192.23.1, the netmask is 255.255.255.0, and the nameserver
address is 128.192.44.67. NOTE: it is important to use the
numeric IP addresses, not the actual host names. NOTE: If you
have other Internet programs currently installed on your machine,
such as a Gopher client or the Trumpet newsreader, you can
probably find the information you need in the configuration files
used for those programs. If the application is based on the
Waterloo TCP package, it will have it's own WATTCP.CFG, in which
case you can simply copy it over to your DOOM directory. When you
have collected all this information, unzip the iDOOM distribution
archive (e.g. IDOOM11.ZIP) into your DOOM (or DOOM2) directory.
Use your favorite ASCII text editor to edit the file called
WATTCP.CFG. Edit or add the following lines in WATTCP.CFG:

my_ip=
gateway=
nameserver=
netmask=

     On our example machine, the WATTCP.CFG file looks like this: 
     
my_ip=128.192.23.5
gateway=128.192.23.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
nameserver=128.192.44.67

     Save the changed file and exit back to DOS.

     If you know your machine's IP address, but you can't
determine the other values, you can often get away with some
educated guesswork. For instance, the gateway for a subnet
usually has an IP address ending in .1, as is the case with our
example. Thus, if your IP address is xxx.yyy.zzz.www, try setting
your gateway's IP address to xxx.yyy.zzz.1. As for the subnet
mask, a common value for this parameter is 255.255.255.0. In some
cases, the gateway value can be something like xxx.yyy.1.1 with a
corresponding netmask value of 255.255.0.0 - if one doesn't work,
it can't hurt to try the other. Finally, if you don't know your
nameserver's IP address, you can probably get by without it for
the purposes of DOOM playing. Since you'll be specifying IP
addresses for all of your opponents' machines, a nameserver
lookup won't be necessary to resolve their addresses. 

     Step 3: Test your TCP/IP setup. Load your packet driver with
the appropriate interrupt, IRQ, I/O and memory addresses. Next,
unzip the TCPINFO and PING programs from the WATTCP apps archive
into your DOOM directory. At the DOS prompt, type:

          TCPINFO    

and press the <Enter> key. If your WATTCP.CFG values are set up
correctly, and if your packet driver and net connection are
functional, you'll see a couple of screens of information about
your system, including your ethernet address and the parameters
you specified in the WATTCP.CFG file. 

     If everything looks OK, the next step is to use the PING
program to attempt to establish contact with your subnet gateway.
At the DOS prompt, type

     PING <yourgateway's.numeric.ip.address>

and press the <Enter> key. After a brief delay, you should see a
message telling you that the host is responding, as well as the
round trip time for PING's test packets. If you see the "Timeout"
error message, then something is wrong with your setup; if your
PC is unable to reach your gateway, it will be unable to reach
the rest of the Internet as well, since all network packets which
are sent to nodes outside of your local area network must pass
through your gateway. For our sample system, we would type:

          ping 128.192.23.1

If your gateway PING was successful, try PINGing your Domain Name
Server (at the IP address you specified in WATTCP.CFG) as well as
some well-known site on the internet (e.g. infant2, which is at
IP address 129.79.234.115). These will test your machine's
ability to connect with other machines outside of your subnet as
well as those outside of your site. All of these PINGs should
result in a "host responding" message with a response time. If
any of these attempts fails, recheck your entries in WATTCP.CFG
and/or get some help from your network administrator. Examples
for our test system:

     ping 128.192.44.67

and

     ping 129.79.234.115


Put Me in, Coach - I'm Ready to Play! 
     First, go find up to three of your most patient frag
buddies. Since this is your first attempt at Internet DOOM, it's
best to try and find someone on your local network who's willing
to put in a little frag time with you. Connections on your local
net will be faster and less problematic, whereas if you attempt a
long distance connection your first time out, you'll have a hard
time discerning problems caused by distance from problems caused
by an incorrect configuration.

     Decide amongst yourselves which machine will be the "server"
(the remaining machines in the game will all be "clients"). The
server machine (and there can only be ONE server per game) acts
as the coordinator for that session. The player operating the
server is in some sense "the boss" - she can decide when to start
the game, which parameters (e.g. -altdeath, -nomonsters, -warp, -
skill, etc.) will be used, whether to kick a player out, and so
on.

     The server starts iDOOM as follows:

iDOOM -server [other game parameters]

     Once the server has started iDOOM running, the clients (all
remaining players) can then connect to the server. Each client
invokes iDOOM using the command line:

iDOOM -client <server_address>

     As an example, consider several computers which are part of
a local area network in a computer lab. In this lab there are
identical machines sitting side by side, with sequential IP
addresses, i.e. 128.192.23.4, 128.192.23.5, and 128.192.23.6.
After stepping through the basic configuration process outlined
above on all test machines, my frag buddies and I are ready to
begin. First, we all agree to play our favorite DEATHMATCH level,
DOOM I episode 1 map 5. We also agree to play in -altdeath mode,
with -skill 5 and -nomonsters. On my machine, which we decided
will be the server, I type:

iDOOM -server -warp 1 5 -altdeath -skill 5 -nomonsters

     The iDOOM screen comes up, and a message is displayed
informing me that iDOOM is entering server mode. This screen is
divided into several sections: the credits, the output window,
the status bar, and the input line. At the top of the screen is
the name of the program, its version number, and the copyright
notice. The large area beginning with the second screen line and
continuing to the 22nd screen line is the output window. Here is
where iDOOM will display all status messages as well as the chat
text entered by the other players. Below the output window is the
status bar, where the current game settings are displayed. Below
the status bar is the input line where all the text I type on my
keyboard will appear. Finally, the bottom line of the screen
lists significant contributors to iDOOM.

     Once my iDOOM server is up and running, all the other
players can connect to it. The other guys type:

iDOOM -client 128.192.23.5

     Each client's screen layout is identical to that of my
server. iDOOM displays a message confirming that it is entering
client mode and connecting to the server. As each client's
connection is established, the arrival of each player is
announced by the server. 

     During this phase of the game setup, all players who have
connected thus far can type messages to each other using iDOOM's
built-in chat facility. To send a message to the other players in
the game, I simply type my message on the keyboard. My keystrokes
appear in the input line at the bottom of the screen, and when I
press <ENTER>, the text will be echoed to the screens of all
players (along with an indication of who sent the message). The
identical procedure can be used to send messages from each of the
client machines. The server itself will also send messages.
Messages from the server will begin with three asterisks ("***"). 

     When a client connects to the iDOOM server, the client
receives a message containing the game parameters which will be
used during that session. These game settings will be displayed
on the status bar. The settings are abbreviated to ensure that
they will all fit within the available space. These game settings
may be changed interactively at the server console.

     My friend sees that I have selected E1M5 as the default
episode and map for our game. He reminds me that we've been
playing that one a lot lately, and suggests we change to E2M2
since we haven't played that one in a while. I agree, and issue
the commands /episode 2 and /map 2 to change the level. Our
status lines are immediately updated to reflect these changes.

     Once I have determined (via the chat facility) that everyone
is ready to begin the game, I press the F10 key. The iDOOM server
signals the clients that the game is beginning, the chat facility
is shut down, and iDOOM sets up the connections which will be
used for the actual game. Once these network links are
established between all the machines, the message "Prepare to
meet your DOOM!" is displayed, followed by the usual DOOM startup
information. Shortly thereafter, the screen melts away and there
we are, in E1M5, pistols at the ready! 

     Give your buddies a good thrashing - you've earned it! Now,
after you've gotten DOOM working on your own subnet, you're ready
for the final step. Find a partner who is also capable of playing
Internet DOOM. Watch the posts in alt.games.doom, or tune into
the #doom, #tcpdoom or #iDOOM channels on irc. You and he will
negotiate game parameters, such as which map to play, which skill
level, and so on. You'll also decide on who will be the server
and who will be the clients (experienced DEATHMATCHers will often
try very hard to avoid being the server, since that player's
uniform is colored day-glo green and is easier to spot in a
DEATHMATCH). Now simply add the parameters you've agreed on to
the iDOOM server command line you used before. A typical          
command line will look something like

          iDOOM -server -skill 5 -nomonsters -deathmatch 

Oh Oh - It's Not Working!

          OK, so you've done everything, just like I've shown
you, but you're still having problems. The following are some
suggestions to try in case of trouble.

     Q: When I try to connect to the iDOOM server it returns to
DOS saying "Server is not responding" or "Remote reset
connection."

     A: This means that the player on the server machine hasn't
yet  started the iDOOM server. The server must be started before
the clients try to connect to it. Try again in a few seconds.


     Q: I keep seeing an "ICMP: port unreachable" message on my
screen.

     A: This message is generated by the other machine when the
port being requested by the sender is unavailable on the          
destination machine. I've seen this happen in some cases when I
started iDOOM before the other player did. Once the other iDOOM
was running, the ICMP: messages went away, and the game linked up
normally. If you see this message, you might also want to try
using a different port (see the iDOOM documentation on the -port
command line parameter). 

     Q: The music starts up fine, but all I see is a BSOD (Black
Screen of Death).
     Q: My machine displays "sending network start info" or
"listening for network start info" and then locks up. 

     A: This problem can have several causes. Perhaps the server
specified a DOOM II game, but one of the players didn't have DOOM
II. Perhaps one of the other players' machines is slower than the
others, or has a fragmented disk and takes a longer time to load
DOOM at startup. Or perhaps some packets were lost - iDOOM uses
UDP (user Datagram Protocol) packets to exchange game information
between all machines in the game. UDP packets are not guaranteed
to reach their destination, and there is no mechanism for the
sender to even be informed that what it sent never made to the
destination machine. iDOOM is designed to compensate for these
lost packets to the extent possible, and occasionally this
detection and correction takes a few extra seconds. You should
always wait for at least 30 - 45 seconds for the other DOOM
engines to sync up before you abort the setup. 

                        Frag Servers/Frag Trackers

     Frag Servers are a recent development. They facilitate iDOOM
connections between multiple players quickly and easily and with
a minimum of command line typing. Current versions of the Frag
Servers are very similar to the server built into iDOOM. NOTE: An
iDOOM client can NOT connect to a Frag Server. Frag Servers have
their own client program which then loads iDOOM as the network
driver. 

     As of this writing, the latest version of the frag
client/server package is TCPSRV12.ZIP, available from one of the
infant2 mirrors in the /pub/doom/multi_doom/net directory. A
couple of the more popular fragservers can be found at
ararat.cs.ucdavis.edu and patriot.et.buy.edu. Both of these
support 2, 3 and 4 player games on ports 1666, 1667, and 1668
respectively.

     Future versions of the Frag Servers (which will be known as
Frag Trackers) will serve as online meeting places where DOOM
players can log on, see a list of games which are awaiting
players, and either join an existing game or register a new game.
Waiting players will be able to send chat messages to each other,
negotiate and set game parameters, check connection quality, etc.
Although this exciting capability does not exist in the current
Frag Servers, it will be available sometime in the near future,
and will revolutionize the way Internet DOOM is played.

[8-6]: How can I setup DOOM to be played on a multi-player BBS?
===============================================================
     Applied Personal Computing, Inc. has recently developed a platform that
allows almost any multiline BBS to host 2-4 player network DOOM games.

     The APCi MultiPlayer Game Server allows gamers to create a simulated
IPX network just by dialing the host BBS at high speed.  APCi MultiPlayer
Game Client software makes use of the APCi MultiPlayer Game Server very
intuitive for even the newest user of online services.  Best of all,
all APCi MultiPlayer Game Client software is FREEWARE and includes any
and all information desired about the supported game.

     For more information regarding the APCi MultiPlayer Game Server, or to
witness the APCi MPGS in action, call the APCi BBS at (618) 632-7664.  You
may also contact APCi at 1-800-535-APCi.  More information can also be
requested from Kevin Sawyer (sawyerk@delphi.com).

(8-7): Where can I find multi-player partners?
==============================================
        A good place to find people to play with is on Usenet is the
"alt.games.doom" newsgroup or on IRC on the #DOOM channel.

=SECTION TWO= CHEATS AND SPOILERS
=================================

-------------------------------------
CHAPTER [9]: How can I cheat in DOOM?
-------------------------------------

*9-1*: What are the DOOM cheat codes?
=====================================
        Here is a list of the cheat codes from DOOM.  During play, just type
the codes in with the keyboard.  You need not hit ENTER after the code.
After entering, a message should be displayed at the top of the screen
telling which cheat mode was activated.

  idbehold        Displays menu (followed by S, V, I, R, A, or L for choice)
                        S=Strength (Berserk)
                        V=Invulnerability
                        I=Partial invisibility
                        A=Full Automap (computer map)
                        R=Anti-radiation suit
                        L=Light amplification visors
  idchoppers      Gives you the chain saw (long story behind the message)
  idclev          Warp (followed by episode number and level number)
# idclip          No clipping (you can walk through walls)
  iddqd           Degreelessness mode (God mode)
  iddt            Toggles Automap between normal, full, and full with objects
                  (enter when in Automap mode)
+ idfa            Gives full ammo, 200% armor, and all weapons but no keys
  idkfa           Very Happy Ammo (full ammo, 200% armor, all weapons & keys)
# idmus           Changes the music to a certain mission (followed by 
                  episode and level number)
  idmypos         Displays your bearing and coordinates in hex
@ idspispopd      No clipping (you can walk through walls)

#: Found only in DOOM II
@: Only found in in DOOM I
+: Only found in DOOM v1.4bt and up

*9-2*: What command line parameters exist?
==========================================
        To use most of these parameters, start DOOM by typing:
"doom -devparm <parameter> <more parameters>".  If the "-devparm" parameter
is not needed, the parameter will be marked with a plus (+).  Most of these
parameters can be mixed and matched to create different effects.  For
instance, typing "doom -devparm -wart 1 8 -record demo01 -respawn" would
record a demo on episode one, level eight, with monster respawn.  Lastly,
typing F1 during development mode will allow a 256 color screen capture in
PCX format.

@<filename>                    Used to read in a command line parm file
-altdeath                      Activates DeathMatch v2.0 (v1.4 and above)
-avg                           Ends the game after 20 minutes
-cdrom                         Uses C:\DOOMDATA directory for data

    The three terminals should have the parameters:

                "doom -devparm -nodes 3"
                "doom -devparm -nodes 3 -right"
    Then, set up the left and right terminal monitors next to the middle
    monitor, in a virtual-reality type configuration.  When you turn your
    head, you see the screen turned 90 degrees!  This ONLY works with
    versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 of DOOM.

+++: Must be used in conjunction with the "-WARP" parameter

#: For the "-playdemo" and "-timedemo" options, if you give an LMP file name
   of "demo#" (i.e. "demo3"), then that internal demo will be played if the
   external LMP file is not found.  For example, to play the internal 1.6
   shareware demo #2 (multiplayer demo), type "doom -playdemo demo2".
   Additionally, when using "-timedemo," the game will give you two 
   numbers after you quit to DOS, GAMETICS and REALTICS.  To determine
   the DOOM frame rate use the formula (GAMETICS/REALTICS) * 35.

Note: DO NOT name your LMP demos ExMx.LMP, or they will *NOT* work.

        If anyone has any idea what the "unknown" or question marked
parameters do, send me some E-mail!

[9-2-1]: What do the dots that appear in development mode mean?
---------------------------------------------------------------
        Direct from id, the final formula for calculating the frame
rate that the dots represent has been determined.  The formula to convert
dots to frames per second is:

                                 70
                        --------------------
                        <NUMBER OF DOTS> + 1

        This chapter is full of spoilers for people who are "stuck" in the
game.  Enjoy!

[10-1]: Where are the DOOM secret levels?
=========================================

[10-1-1]: Knee-Deep in the Dead
-------------------------------
        You must be on level three to access the secret level in DOOM.
First, there is a room with an elevator with armor on it in the northwest
corner of the map.  Press the red button in this room. This opens a corridor
in the room where you can see a glowing sphere.  The room it leads to has
some lighted alcoves.  Walk up the stairs.  You should be able to hear a
mechanical sound.  This is the sound of two alcoves being lowered.  The map
looks similar to this drawing.  (I love the beauty of ASCII art)

                        Alcove 1 /\ /\
                                 \/    \
                                /   /\   \
                              /     /  \   \
                            /   /\/      \   \
                            \   \        /   /
                            /\   \    /    /
                            \/ \   \/      \
                        Alcove 2 \     /\    \
                                   \/     \    \
                                            \    \
                                              \ x
                                             ENTRANCE

        Walking into this room normally, the alcoves rise before you can see
them.  But, if you run up the stairs to one of the alcoves fast enough,
you can get in it and rise to a secret door.  Alcove 2 leads to the
blue glowing sphere.  Alcove 1 leads to an island surrounded by ooze.
You can get a rocket launcher here.  In alcove 1, follow the ooze down
the tunnel.  The tunnel leads to a switch that raises the bridge over the
opening ooze pit.  A secret door is also near the switch, but the bridge
leads to the secret exit.  REMEMBER TO >BOOK< TO THE ALCOVE! :)

[10-1-2]: The Shores of Hell
----------------------------
        When you get to Command Center, walk out the elevator door, and
turn right.  Walk up the stairs in the far right corner.  At their top of
the stairs, enter the door to the right.  Walk to the end of the hallway.
Open the door, and look to the right.  Open that door and turn the switch
immediately on the right in that room.  That switch raises stairs in the hall
you just left.  Walk up those stairs, get through the red curtain, and get on
the transporter.  Kill the lost souls in the room you are transported to
and open the hidden door there (a lion head marks it).  Again use the
transporter, and you will find yourself walking towards a marked EXIT-door.
Enter and turn the switch!

(10-1-3): Inferno
-----------------
        The process of getting to the Inferno secret level is probably one of
the most creative things in DOOM, and the most difficult to figure out.  The
way to get there is from level 6, "Mt. Erebus".  You must get inside a blue
box with no ceiling which is in a large triangular depressed area with
"water" at its bottom.  Inside it is a skull switch ending the level. Getting
inside the box counts as one of the secret passage units for the level.  Next
to the box is a large red building which one can get on top of.  To get on
top of it, you must use the secret teleporter in the building with the
berserk pack and stairs in it, with the four Imp cages by the entrance.  For
specifics, the teleporter leading to the ledge above the blue box is located
at <0x27ed486,0x2315201>.  Upon entering the building, you will see a secret
opening to the teleporter on the left.  The teleporter takes you to a ledge
on the top of the red building.  If you go to the right along the ledge you
will be looking down at the blue box.  Unfortunately, the distance is too far
to jump.  The key is to shoot a rocket at the ledge wall, the explosion of
which will throw you into the box!  The area on the ledge where you want to
fire the rocket at the wall is located at <0x375bead,0xa900072>.  There is a
rocket launcher on the level, on a platform out in the open with a chaingun
and a bunch of monsters.  Finally the exit inside the blue box itself is
located at <0x37f436d,0xc1ffa3c>.  You will take a lot of damage in the
process, even with lots of armor and health, however, there are a few
invulnerability artifacts on the level which will protect you.  One is next
to the wall where the launcher and chaingun are, and the other is inside a
central shack that opens when you enter a nearby enclosure to pick up the
green armor.

*10-2-1-2*: Secrets in Detail
-----------------------------

KNEE DEEP IN THE DEAD

E1M1: HANGAR:

# Just after the zigzag look right for the oddly colored wall <0xBA389D6,
  0xf0e054ec>.  Push it for corridor to a open place with a blue armor vest.
# After you cleaned out the exit room, go back to the zigzag room and look
  right for the shotgun (the tower with the Imp should be lowered now)
  <0xd68473b,0xf2510f63>.
# For DOOM v1.2, a secret area has been added in the above secret room:
  look in the SE corner <0xdeff476,0xf0effdc2> for the elevator.  You'll find
  some armor bonuses up there.  The elevator lowers when you are at the
  entrance <0xb96c465,0xf4879655> in the north, so you'll have to run fast to
  get it.

E1M2: NUCLEAR PLANT:

# The small structure you face when you begin, has a secret door in the SE
  corner (the lighter wall part) <0x15005a8,0x121e8ad>.  Behind the door is a
  room with a red switch.  Pushing that switch will open a secret door in the
  northern corner of the stairs in the east <0x60ada92,0x3affa0b>.  You can get
  outside and collect a supercharger and a chaingun.
+ Behind the red door you'll see a stair twisting to the right.  On the top is
  an indention to your left <0xf9900144,0x3a49ddd>.  If you step on it, it will
  drop down.  You will find enemies to your right, and you will also see (but
  not be able to get) the chainsaw.
# A bit ahead you'll see a lift.  Push the first panel to your left
  <0xf9d0052a,0x5aa56a6>.  You'll be able to kill those Imps from the ridge.
# In the southern part of the maze (to get in, pull the switch behind the pillar
  in the green toxic directly to the right behind the red door <0xfdc004de,
  0x446230f>), shoot the middle most western wall (the one behind the green
  armor vest) <0xf79e0d81,0xfe82feac> for access to the chainsaw (push the
  switch in NW to lower the pillar so you can get it).
  In the same hidden area is some extra armor hidden behind the eastern wall in
  the northeastern corner of the stairs <0xf82fdc62,0x151532f>.
# In the most eastern part of the maze, push the wall between the white stripes
  <0x1eff099,0xfc88d4d4d3> for a backpack.

E1M3: TOXIC REFINERY:

+ The strange grey wall straight ahead beyond the first door you open is a
  secret drawbridge.  The switch for the drawbridge is in one of the chambers
  described below.
# In the room in the NW (the one that opens as soon as you push the red button
  and that contains the yellow key) are TWO secret passages (the second niche
  on your left <0xf3c7ca46,0xf7dfc822> and the second niche on your right
  <0xf5ac3fd1,0xfac4d713>), both will open when you're on the stairs but will
  close again after a (very) short while.  Go to the stairs and then run like
  hell as soon as you hear them lower. It'll help when you shoot the drums that
  might get in the way.
# In the northern niche (leading to a rocket launcher and a green armor) is a
  secret room in the SE corner (just follow the green stuff to the right).
  Run fast for minimum damage.  You'll see a backpack and the switch for the
  drawbridge at the beginning.  To the east is the exit (a lighter colored
  wall part <0xf6aff87a,0xfbd990b9>) through another secret chamber
  containing the chaingun.
# In the south-eastern niche (the second on the right) is a supercharger (pull
  the switch on back of the pillar).
# The drawbridge should be lowered now.  Cross it, but be careful! There are
  a lot of Imps lurking behind automaticaly opening doors.  My tactic is to
  select the chain gun, run forward and back up as soon as you hear the doors
  open.  Then take them out at your leisure.  Note that you can also shoot some
  of them via the secret `window' in the SE <0xf9480573,0xf8b2d736>.
+ In the north of the room is a corridor, follow it to find the hidden-level-
  switch.
# To the north of the room with the hidden-level-switch is a elevator, push the
  wall <0xfbe7f1f6,0xfaafee8c> to lower it, so you can get the rocketbox.
# Behind the blue door in the eastern corner is a secret door (the lighter
  patch in the SE <0xfd6ffcd8,0xf7a33c3b>).  The chainsaw, a supercharger, a
  blue armor and a partial invisibility is available.

E1M9: MILITARY BASE:

You start facing a open space with a cage full of Imps in the middle. The
following rooms are described relative to that cage.

+ In the northeast is a pentagram on the floor.  If you touch it, numerous
  enemies will warp in.  Try walking around it and then running to the
  corridor.  That way you can pick them off one by one.
+ In the eastern room is a lift/trapdoor at the middle of the eastern wall
  <0x75cf281,0x2fa03b> (the highlighted patch on the floor).  To the NE are a
  green armorvest.
# Also in the eastern room is a lift/trapdoor in the SW-corner <0x6102f19,
  0xff10138d> leading to a indoor lake with the chaingun.
# The same area is accessible via the lift/trapdoor in the NE-corner
  <0x3d000fe,fcd013ff> of the southern room.
# In the northern chamber, push the middle eastern wall <0x3efe3b3,0x479d0cd>.
  You'll get into a chamber with several high pillars.  The pillar at the far
  side of the room <0x7ad637b,0x423de32> lowers when someone is on the stairs.
  Just run on it, wait for it to rise, and 'jump' to the other pillars by
  running fast counter clockwise.
+ To get to the end of level switch, run down the trench.  To the NW is a
  isle with the switch and to the south is the lift upstairs.
+ Although they don't count as secrets in themselves, getting on the
  five pillars, each with a weapon or bit of ammo on it, in the secret
  room on the right hand wall of the room with the ooze trench and
  exit, is one of the more challenging things to do in the game.
  Basically, the room on the secret level of episode one "Military
  Base" contains five pillars of increasing height as you go around
  clockwise, along with a lift which lowers when you are on the entry
  stairs, allowing access to the first and highest pillar. The key is
  to go around each pillar in a counter-clockwise direction. Just
  running and jumping toward a pillar isn't enough, as you will go over
  it but fall off the far side, and this can only get you to the first
  and tallest pillar, and the shortest (or maybe the first two on
  either end if you manage to swipe the item off the top of the second
  pillar before falling). The key is to shift+forward run at each
  pillar, take off and jump toward it, and right when you reach it,
  briefly press the down arrow to move backward. This will stop your
  running and you will be standing still on the next pillar. If you
  move back too soon you will hit the pillar and fall to the ground;
  too late and you run off the far side. It's best to give yourself a
  running start for each pillar and line yourself up so you will be
  jumping over the minimum distance possible. Using the automap under a
  high zoom level can help here. This actually isn't as hard as it may
  seem to get right. I understand some can do this all in one fell
  running swoop by turning in mid-routine, but this is a surer way.

E1M4: COMMAND CONTROL:

# The light wall to the left in the beginning (before the door) <0x785a47f,
  0x45005ef> hides a backpack.
# The south exit from the round chamber (the one with the radiation suits)
  leads to a trench.  Follow the trench east for the rocket launcher and a
  supercharger.  To get the supercharger, simply stand on the left side of
  the lift and press the switch.  If you are just barely on the lift, you
  can reach the switch while on the lift.  Follow the trench west to get
  out.

E1M5: PHOBOS LAB:

# The chamber in the middle (behind the first stairs you encounter from the
  start) has a secret chamber to the south (behind the drums) <0x15a4aa6,
  0x1a0025b> with a shotgun.
# In of the east of this chamber is a toxic lake.  In the SE-corner of the
  toxic is a secret passage (the strangely colored wall) <0x466e20d,0x12009bc>.
  There is a rocket launcher and a blue armorvest.
+ In the NW behind the yellow keycard door is a chamber with two pillars and
  an isle with a switch in the green stuff.  In the indention in the west
  <0xf8e024a0,0x34ff9c5> is a secret chamber with the antiradiation suit. The
  south wall of this chamber hides another room with the chainsaw. The south
  wall thereof gives away to let you outside and get the supercharger.
  You can get the blue armor in the NE-corner by stepping on the northern
  pillar when it's down, waiting until it rises again and then 'jumping'
  over.  Ammo can be found by repeating the same action on the souther
  pillar.
# Two platforms with Imps hidden in the walls behind the yellow keycard door
  act as elevator in DOOM v1.2.  The southern one doesn't lead anywhere.
  The northern one <0xfc2fd5ee,0x4f92783> has a secret wall to the east which
  leads to a secret room with a partial invisibility and a shortcut to the
  darkroom (via the north).  The pentagram is a teleporter back to the
  beginning.
# In the north eastern chamber (the one with the blue floor and the blinking
  light) has a secret chamber to the SE <0x52fbab5,0x3d001f3> with a backpack,
  a chaingun and a computer map.
# In the northern darkroom is a partially hidden chamber to the SW.  The best
  way to get there is to follow the wall left.  You'll find the night vision,
  which is very useful in sniping those baddies in the dark.
+ In the northern darkroom the top of the /\ in the middle wall is also a
  secret door, but as far as I can see this isn't really useful (maybe for
  dashing for the exit?)

E1M6: CENTRAL PROCESSING:

+ At the first 'crossing' you encounter, look in the NW corner.  There is a
  partially hidden chamber <0xfd4ff0b2,0xfe5ab835> with some ammo, health and
  a green armor vest.  There are also some Imps there, so to be safe, fire a
  shot into it to detonate the barrels and kill them.
# Behind the red door in the southwest is a green lake.  In the NE-corner
  is an anti-radiation-suit.  In the 'middle' (the tunnel in the SW) is a
  supercharger.  In the SE-corner is a nightvision, a partial invisibility,
  a blue armor and the exit from the lake.
# Just before you are by the blue door there is a secret chamber to the
  south.  Before you're at the blue door, there is a tower with Imps
  <0x31dc6cd,0xfdc354b5>.  When you reach the blue door it will lower so you
  can get in.  You will see an anti-radiation-suit. Push the south wall for a
  backpack, a rocket launcher, a partial invisibility and a back way into the
  room with the yellow key.
# In the same area as where the lowering tower is, is a corridor to the north.
  As soon as you get the yellow key, it will be accessable.  The twisting path
  over the toxic waste will lead to a backpack and a door to the outside. There
  you will see a supercharger on a pillar <0x1125332,0x6c93ef6>. The pillar
  will lower as soon as someone goes near it. Step on it and as soon as it has
  risen, press the wall to the west to get inside the complex again.
+ In the room immediately before the ending room, there is a radiation suit
  available behind one of the pillars.
# In the most eastern corridor is a strangely colored wall <0xd2ffa4f,
  0xf9fc115f>.  Push it to get the computer map.

E1M7: COMPUTER STATION:

# In the southwest is a big pillar <0xfe5cda63,0xf7ff97d9> that will descend
  when you are on the stairs east of it.  Stand on top of it, wait until is
  has risen sufficiently and jump on the ledge in the NE <0xffdfe6c0,
  0xf9237c97> for the computer map or the south lake in the NE corner
  <0xff1e2866,0xf72ffeb0> for the chaingun and (when you leave via the secret
  door to the east) a backpack.  Jump in the lake in the north and run fastly
  to the tunnel in the NW <0xfdf75b77f,0xfa229120>.  In the west of that tunnel
  is a radiation-suit and in the east behind the door with the light are some
  goodies and a switch.  Throwing the switch will allow you to get to the
  chainsaw later on in the room in the extreme SW <0xfacc64c4,0xf5a40aa1>.
  Leave the tunnel via the north and look behind the pillar <0xfea017a9,
  0xfacffbc5> in that lake for blue armor.  Follow the acid to the north to the
  supercharger <0xfdb37a3a,0xffa1e2e2> and leave via the east.
# After you get the blue key in the northwest, two hidden areas will open to
  free Imps and former humans.  The secret room in the middle of the map
  <0x1319742,0xfa50049c> has a false wall to the east which leads to
  outside so you can get a partial invisibility.

E1M8: PHOBOS ANOMALY:

# The only secret room <0x1cfdaa6,0x17bdce1> is in the east in the corridor
  leading to the first door and contains a supercharger.
+ Note that there is a map in the east of your starting point.

THE SHORES OF HELL

E2M1: DEIMOS ANOMALY:

# The SE-corner <0x63aba49,0xfdd82d07> of big room in middle (the one with
  the windows to the east, the south and the west) turns into a teleporter to
  the plasma-gun after you pull the switch <0x4e7f923,0xfee0883b> on the outer
  west side and push the button on the west side of the little wall that rises
  out of the floor (the east switch opens the passage to the red key).
# In the SW is a indention <0x31cb145,0xfb50105e> with two skull-switches.
  Press the eastern skull-switch first for access to a teleporter to a
  corridor filled with bonuses in the north.
# Behind the red door <0x186bb69,0xfd97f0a8> is a blue mega armor and the
  computer map.

E2M2: CONTAINMENT AREA:

# If you walk along the south border of the storage area (the one with all
  those boxes), you'll bump into a box <0xff9751f6,0xb101ab0> which will lower
  if you are north of it, to reveal some shotgun ammo.
# In the south east quadrant are three circles with parts of the floor going
  up and down.  The northern one has a secret corridor <0x82ff4df,0x22fd506>
  in the north leading to the blue door in the north, filled with
  life-bonuses.
# In the SW area (with three corridors with the blue lights on the ground and
  ceiling) is a partially hidden corridor <0xff85ce0a,0x6b92713> in the NW
  corner of the most western corridor. When you try to get the backpack, the
  wall behind you will close and the wall in front of you will lower,
  revealing some Imps. The door behind you will open after a while. The
  SE corner <0x2afe532,0x7011ab87> (the black-colored wall) is the
  secret door to a small chamber.  The SE corner <0x3682291,0x6ebaa52>
  of that small chamber (the wall with the small green light) hides a
  corridor <0x4afeea4,9x667fa8e> back to non-hidden territory (the
  lightly colored wall).  The most south part of the corridor
  <0x414d0b4,0x5d0039e> (the black wall part) gives away to a
  computermap.
# In the south middle quadrant is a room <0x1baafb3,0x1d7344b> with two
  pillars, one khaki, one with tubes (to get there leave the three
  corridors with the blue lights via the way you came in.  Turn right
  and first left. The room on your left [east] is the one you seek).
  The west (khaki) pillar <0x31dc5c4,0x2901565> has a switch on the north
  side, with which you can lower the eastern pillar to get the plasma
  gun.
# In the south middle quadrant is a corridor with skull crushing
  doors.  To get by them, run forward as soon as they start to go up.
  Take them one at a time.  The middle one <0x3f4c349,0xff1006b4> (third
  one from either side) has a secret passage in the north ridge, leading
  to the chainsaw.  When you get it lost souls will try to get you from
  hidden rooms in the south and east.
+ The room <0x6ec4d6b,0x3a0ad08> with the yellow keycard in the south
  middle has a bridge hidden under the red blood, following blue lights
  on the ceiling, just walk forward and back again fast to make them
  rise.
# The western room behind the yellow door <0x456db4c,0xdc9ca53> contains
  the chaingun, just flip the switch!
# In the eastern room <0x852f5ab,0xdadd4d9> behind the yellow door
  you'll see three rooms to your right and three auto-rising pillars to
  the north. You can get the backpack on the middle pillar by running
  over the pillar when it starts to rise or later on. The switch on the
  eastern pillar <0x95f38f8, 0x11901ab9> opens the middle door
  containing the rocket launcher.  Flip the switch on the middle pillar
  <0x85ba244,0x11900694> for the south chamber (with ammo) and the one
  on the west pillar <0x75fa7ef,0x11900ad> for the north chamber
  (containing a rocketbox). It's best to pull all switches after each
  other.  Note that the pillars lower as soon as you enter one of the
  rooms, so you can't open any doors after that! (but you can get the
  backpack).
# To get the last secret go into the room with the blue keycard,
  <0x9e4f2bb,0x5affb22> and look up at the four corners.  Note that the
  extreme southeast corner is lit up unlike the other corners. Go and
  stand in this corner and face along the wall.  The platform with the
  supercharge on it will lower <0x9e41c9a, 0x5eff45c>.  Run across and
  get it before it rises again.  It will only go down once, so you only
  get one chance at it.  This is one of the harder secrets in all of
  DOOM to find and get to.

E2M3: REFINERY:
# In the most SW corner of the map is a corridor <0xfba6989a,0xfed0450f>
  to the room with the blue key containing the plasma gun.  To get the
  plasma gun, jump in the red blood and run north (right) fast.
# In the middle south is a room with a five-sided green lake.  The wall
  <0x2847ab9,0xfe90013e> to the south east (the part with between the
  light lines) offers a shortcut.
# The next secret on this level is similar to and next to the one
  above.  You can get out of the room with the green lake
  <0x25ff9c6, 0xfe9f8db4> via a one way secret door on the wall in front of
  the main entry way, which leads back to the room with the imp cage.  The
  other secret door above refers to a one way door into this room which is on
  the wall across from where the rising and falling platforms with candles on
  them are.
# In the south east is a partially hidden cage with Imps
  <0x1de36ff,0x10156d>.  You can enter via the NW corner <0x2effa57,0x951b16>
  to get the backpack.
# Follow the corridor behind the blue door through the open area and the room
  with all those pillars and blinking light to the green toxic stuff.  If you
  go around the corner <0x52fff7d,0x313783c> in the SE, you will find a
  radiation suit.  In the middle of the eastern wall <0x6729d81,0x42cd91e> of
  the green stuff is a corridor to a room with the supercharger in the NE
  corner <0x85000da,0x3eac965>.

E2M4: DEIMOS ANAMOLY:
# In the middle of the south wall <0xfd743e02,0xf5510517> of the beginning room
  (directly opposite to the TL's to the north), hides a room with the shotgun.
# Take the teleporter to big room.  In the north is a elevator.  Press the
  head left of it to go up.  You'll see a green armor and a computermap.
  To get them push the little red pillar <0xadc846c,0xfebfff01> with the skull
  on it in the NE corner.
# To the north of the big O formed by green toxic waste is a secret door
  <0x59bf44d,0xfb6fe831>. It opens if you have walked via the corridor
  <0x75b231a,0xf6c3a683> in the SE of the big O.  There is a supercharger and
  radiation suit. (Don't forget the partial invisibility south to the entrance)
# To the west of the big O with green toxic waste is a corridor with a T to the
  north <0x213d209,0xf9a64b57>. To the east of that corridor is a secret wall
  <0x27fad41,0xfab20726> with a partial invisibility and a chaingun. Shoot the
  wall to get them.
# In the great round corridor in north, behind the blue door: In the east is a
  `dent' <0x4ed2810,0xff5f15c1> in the ring. This is a trapdoor with a secret
  door to the east and leads to a plasma gun and a teleport to the middle of
  the great round corridor.
# In the great round corridor in the north: follow NE corridor to a room with
  lava.
  - The small door <0x62ffe68,0x3b6bde> in the SW leads to a small green lake.
    The SW corner has a blue armorvest behind some drums.
  - In NE corner <0x815a37c,0x2c8c810> behind the lava is a secret door.
  Warning! the SE branch of the corridor behind it leads to a crushing ceiling.
  Outrun it and push the green patch <0xa6ffd1d,0x64560a> in the east for the
  exit. The SW branch lets you go back to the lavaroom.
# In the room above, just over the edge of the wall, is a small ledge
  with some medikits <0x6ff9294,0x22b3e1f> on them which normally aren't
  visible from the room and can be missed when running over the lava to the
  secret door.
# In the south middle behind the place where you find the blue keycard, is a
  small twisty path <0x3550d3b,0xf5c84264> high above the acid.  In the SW
  part of the toxic <0x35019f4,0xf510358a> is a berserker.
# After you open the door to the exit, look back and get the supercharger
  <0x7e9bcac,0xf5497b99>.
+ Note: for those of you still searching for that damn switch so you can get
  to the exit: go in the lake and then towards the exit.  The switch is on the
  right wall of the teleporter left of the exitdoor.

E2M5: COMMAND CENTER:

# The room where the first door leads to has two secret rooms in the space
  between the room and the stairs.  The doors <0xfb80ba93,0x7dbd7cc>
  <0xf8373cba,0x7e031f5> are facing the south and will open automatically to
  reveal Imps and ammo.
+ The ridges <0xfca60096,0x3febfc5> <0xf71000d0,0x3e622b8> of the green lakes
  of the big room south of the begin both lead back to normal territory.
# In the SW is a roughly (--) shaped room.  In the room NW of the middle
  of this (--) is a switch <0xf3efdd28,0x1367f57> which activates a stair so
  you can walk through the fake fire <0xf29412f7,0x18d236d> in the NW corner.
  The teleporter there takes you to an area infested with lost souls.  The west
  wall <0xf4690f4,0x496136d> with the head leads to another room with
  transporter.  That transporter takes you to the switch <0xfe9fb836,0x92ff44b>
  for the secret level.
# In the room east to the room in the south middle with the room to the N,E,
  and W and a view to the circular stairway in the south, is a secret door
  <0xfbaff1cb,0xae3ad8> in the NE corner (near the cozy head-fire) hiding the
  chainsaw.
# In the center of the circular stairway is a anti-radiation suit guarded by
  a demon.  The door <0xf94949db,0xfe6d93d0> to it will open as soon as
  you are at the top of the stairs <0xfa165eed,0xfdd56896>.
# The south door directly after the circular stairway leads to two corridors.
  The eastbound corridor is the way to the exit, the westbound leads to C
  formed green lake in the west.  In the north of that lake is a door
  <0xf1a21e52,0xfe94f08f> (behind the ammo clip).  Follow it to a baron of hell
  in a cage.  North of that you will see a long corridor with three doors to
  the east.  The northern and southern doors lead to a ledge around the lake
  to the east.  The middle door <0xf27dc571,0x826c8a6> (the wall part with the
  pentagram over the ugly head) leads to the isle <0xf5420514,0x823f2c1> in
  the middle of the lake, where you'll find a plasma gun. To activate the
  bridge to the isle, you have to push the button <0xf2aff9f7,0xfd1cd93e> in
  the room in the center of the C-formed lake you passed while coming here.
  BTW: If you fall in the lake, the transporter <0xf42dc0b0,0x7500bcf> in the
  indention in the SW brings you back to the beginning.
# In the slime lake mentioned above, not only is there a teleporter,
  but there is also another niche with a cell pack in it
  <0xf29859a4,0x8bf7c8b>.

E2M9: FORTRESS OF MYSTERY:

There are no secrets in this level.

E2M6: HALLS OF THE DAMNED:
+ In the SE where you find the blue keycard, two rooms with demons will open
  automatically. The SW one has a chainsaw behind the brown wall <0x6362f60,
  0xff151336>.
+ Three parts of the mazes are secret.  All the secrets are off the area at
  the north of the level after going down the long narrow passage to the
  junction.
# The area to the east with the fake exit counts as a secret.
# The area to the north with the goodies on the table counts as a secret.
# The area to the west past the crushing ceiling counts as a secret.


E2M7: SPAWNING VATS:

# In the NW is a corridor with ribbles.  The third indention is a corridor
  leading to a very dark open patch.  In the NE <0x126cccd,0x772feab> is a
  switch which opens a room with a chainsaw.  In the SW <0x32fff5,0x3de1cbe>
  is the plasma gun.
# In the SW is a room with a radiation shield and small patches of green
  acid in indentions along the walls.  The SW indention <0x137b2c8,0xff25986d>
  has a corridor to the south leading to a chamber with a rocket launcher and
  a teleporter.  The teleporter will get you to a red door, with a switch
  <0xffe013c6,0xfd1015b7> behind it.  Pushing that switch will open an
  oute door to a secret room in the beginning-room <0x5d894b7,0x76751d7>
  (SE corner) with a supercharger.  Because this room is protected by two
  doors, a second switch must be flipped to open the second door.
+ To open the inner door, flip the switch that is past the blue keycard
  door, up the stairs, and to the left in the room with the acid pool
  <0x4205835,0x2d00641>.


E2M8: TOWER OF BABEL:

There are no secrets on this level.

INFERNO

E3M1: HELL KEEP

# The small grey chamber before the exit has a secret room <0xfc900da5,
  0x7606912> in west containing the rocketlauncher.

E3M2: SLOUGH OF DESPAIR:

# To get a chaingun, follow the wall to your right (west) to the chaingun
  behind the wall.  The wall will lower when you walk over the red patch
  <0x6b010ab,0x75220b7> to its west side.
+ The second `finger' from the east has some cages with former sergeants.  To
  get into those cages, walk over the red triangle <0x3fa278b,0x817fa0c>.
  The floors of the cages lowers and a wall behind you will come down.
  To lower the triangle column (actually it rises) you want to shoot the
  back wall of one of the six cages the sergeants were in. Shooting it
  raises the pillar exposing the red triangle, walking over which
  lowers the sergeant platforms allowing you to get the stuff in each one.
# In the large circular room at the end of the middle finger is a
  supercharge.
# The plasma gun is hidden in the western part <0x2072324,0x4ecdc0e> of the
  pillar you see when you stand with your back to the second `finger' from the
  west.

E3M3: PANDEMONIUM:

+ In the starting room, a megaarmor can be obtained on a ledge overlooking
  the yard in front of where you start.  When you go up the stairs to the
  right, and then down the elevator to the area which has stairs going down
  to where the blue key is, there is actually a second elevator in the wall
  which leads up to the ledge with the armor.  This second elevator
  <0x48189c,0xfe5f9916> can only be used once, and you must move back
  slightly after pressing the button or else the elevator will catch half way
  up under an overhang.  The armor's ledge does damage so grab it quickly.
+ Directly north of the beginning is a great open place with 4 pillars.
  Pressing the switch <0xfea95756,0xaff327> in the north will lower the middle
  pillar <0xfe921ce9,0xfef4c1db>, so you can get the shotgun.
+ To get to the rooms with the windows to the room in the beginning, go
  north and take both the east and the west stairs, and then south.
# A little north of the middle is a round green lake <0x120905e,0x1754b6d> with
  a lavalike ceiling.  In an indention <0x1c9c5cd,0x1c492ee> in the east is the
  chaingun.
# In the SW is a corridor with two platforms (one in the north and in the
  south).  There is a small corridor in the south.  When you follow it, you'll
  come to a T-split.  In the west (right) is an invulnerability, useful for
  running over the lava in the east. Take the turn left (east).  You should be
  on the southern platform of the corridor.  In the south of that platform you
  can see a lava/blood maze <0xfd9760e5,0x1de4aec>.  In that maze you'll find
  the BFG9000 <0xff1ebaad,0xdeec44> in the SE corner and a supercharger
  <0xfe3afdf3,0x2101114> in the NW corner.  You can also get to the lava maze
  by going directly north from the beginning, then taking the west stairs,
  then following the path north.
# One of the most northern chambers (the one just before the blue door leading
  to the exit) has two air shafts flanking a formation you could describe as a
  coach facing north.   When you stand on the coach <0xff6e17cb,0x532520e> the
  wall part west of the stairs south will lower allowing you to get the map.
  The wall part <0xfffcfa97,0x41c62aa> east of the stairs will lower when you
  push it.
# The last two secrets are in the area to the east of the level, off
  the east hall and over the stairs guarded by lost souls.  Just
  entering the room around beyond it with the lava and Cacodemon counts
  as one secret.  Getting to the area past that with the berserk pack
  and armor counts as another.

E3M4: HOUSE OF PAIN:

+ The first room to the west from the beginning has a secret room <0xfebbbdcd,
  0xc4c579> in the SE corner containing the shotgun.
# In the SW (a bit behind the blue door) is a room with a doors to the east
  (the entrance), to the north (where you find the BFG9000 <0xffdaa1b0,
  0xfd07e1fa> in some lava), to the west (where a lot of Imps and a baron of
  hell await you) and to the south.  The south chamber has a secret room
  <0xff49f58f,0xfae5873e> to the west filled with rockets.
# In the south middle east of the blue door is a room with a door to the north
  and a small patch of blue lake on the east side.  Press the wall <0x3ddce70,
  0xf9d91cc3> a bit more north of that patch of blue for a green armorvest.
+ In the middle is a room with two pillars with switches on all sides.
  Here is a rude ascii-chart of the scene to facilitate solving this.
  [#] is a door opened by switch #
  [Y] is the yellow keycard door
  [R] is the red keycard door
  Behind door 2: an invulnerability

# As drawn above, there is a secret wall <0x6cffeee,0xfdd03be8> in the south of
  the most eastern indention.  It contains a radiation suit.
# The final secret for this level is located to the left of the starting
  room, past the Cacodemon cages and behind the wall.  Using the teleporter
  across the lava to enter the room counts as a secret.

E3M5: UNHOLY CATHEDRAL:

# Take the most western entrance to the cathedral.  Push the west wall
  <0xfc4e8e97,0xfc5dfd80> and get the lightamplifier <0xfad56408,0xfc1fa3ee> in
  the SW corner.
# The most NW chamber (the one with the lava floor) has secret door
  <0xfa4ed057,0x61933f5> to the east with a radiation suit.  The transporter in
  the room leads to the middle of the map/cathedral.
# The east wall <0x2d56f0d,0x9b29c1> of the big central room of the cathedral
  (the one with the four 2x2-teleporters) hides a small niche with a
  supercharger and a chainsaw.  The yellow key is required to open this
  door.
# Also the four stony structures to all sides of the middle warp-in are hollow.
  The doors will automatically open each time you warp in to the middle from
  another place (from outside to inside).
# In the cathedral are four 2x2-teleport-places.  The northern two are
  connected to the north by a corridor.  That corridor has a secret passage
  <0xfd48642a,0x56afd0c> in the NW.
# The most northern room has three switches and a teleport with crushing
  ceilings.
  The SE-switch opens the secret doors in the corridors to the east and west,
  enabling you to get the rocket launcher and some rockets.
  The NE-switch lowers the blue key in the NW-corner.
  The NW-switch lowers the chaingun in the NE-corner.
  The teleporter in the SW teleports you to the NE corner of the cathedral.
# The most eastern room (east of the exit) has a small pit, from where many
  enemies will warp in.  To the east of that room, behind the skull <0x787fd10,
  0x2eaf2e4>, is the BFG9000.
+ For those of you wondering just which damn transporter you have to take to
  get out the middle of the cathedral: it's the most southwestern of the
  northwestern patch of transporters.

E3M6: MT. EREBUS:

+ In the east is a cubus-formed building on a hexagon isle. The east alcove
  <0xd1027ea,0xfe2234b7> is the way in.  In the NW corner <0xb9d75d8,
  0xfeb0d1db> is the backpack.  Pushing the skull <0xbd80026,0xfe22bffe> on
  the west wall lowers the wall in the SE, releasing the enemies trapped there.
  Pushing the skull <0xc5fdf50,0xfe67fb05> on the north wall lowers the wall
  in the NE, so you can get the radiation suit there.
# In the north is a NW-SE oriented structure with two cages with Imps at
  both sides of the entrance.  That structure has a secret door inside in
  the middle of the NE wall <0x3a60e7c,0x356d9b4> (at the small light on the
  floor) and a teleporter in the middle of the SW wall <0x281e808,0x22e23de>.
  The teleporter will put you on a high structure further north.  From
  there you can 'jump' west and get the chainsaw.  You can get out via the
  transporter in the SE side <0x34a6f68,0x9bd1900> of the structure you warped
  on.
# East of the above described NW-SE oriented structure is a small _|_ formed
  building on a small hill.  The building contains two teleporters.  The
  eastern warps you on the NE ridge of the hill, where you can get the plasma
  gun <0x7e352bd,0x1c1c059>. The western transporter also warps you to a ridge
  (NW) of the hill, but there are only some shotgun shells there.
+ The small blue building <0x941bec7,0x293e0bb> in the NE contains a radiation
  suit and cacodemons.
+ All compact flaming red structures contain enemies and a few soul spheres
  or a radiation suit.  Sometimes one of the walls goes down, spilling the
  enemies.
# See Chapter [10-1-3] for information on getting to the secret level.
  This counts as a secret as well.
# The fourth and final secret passage area on this level is inside the
  same building room with the secret teleporter leading to the blue box
  ledge.  On the opposite wall is another hidden wall opening
  <0x3aa61a5,0x365963f> which contains a cell pack.
+ The exit is in the middle west: follow the south wall over the lava, you'll
  see a tunnel <0xfb186e6b,0x54a49e> going north to the blue door, and further
  the exit beyond.

E3M7: GATE TO LIMBO:
# Beyond the northern blue door is a maze of small lava tunnels.  In the SE
  corner <0x7a37332,0x5bec063> of this maze is the BFG9000 and a transporter
  to the SW quadrant of the map.  In the NW is a transporter <0xff7323ef,
  0x824218c> warping to the SW quadrant, the red key <0xfe3f638e,0x6fd04ca>
  and a red door.
+ There are several pillars in the various lava-lakes with red doors, all
  containing transporters:
  (0) In the most SW lake is in the north a pillar <0xf9e908db,0xfc8d60ac>. It
     warps you to a room where you can see the yellow door.  In the same room
     is also a switch <0xfcaffa88,0x45f8a18> on the east wall, pushing it
     activates a bridge in room (1).
  (1) In the middle (big) lake is also a pillar <19c3b9d,362e08> with a
     transporter. It warps you to the room west of the above room.
     In this room is also a yellow door, in it is a switch that activates the
     bridge to the pillar in the middle of a lake (.
  - In the most northern lake are two pillars (east/west). The western pillar
    <ffa72354,6c46d07> has a transporter to the SW ridge looking out over the
    middle pillar..... The switch <f9d003cc,569d8a4> opens a door???
    The eastern pillar <2d380df,57aafc9> leads to the ridge east, with the
    yellow key...
  - SE: 31ff6e7,faea6d2e> NE of tower, with plasma gun.
  - In the NW lake is in the north a pillar <0xfe1aff7a,0x4093707> containing a
    transporter. It warps you to the yellow door.

E3M8: DIS

+ Not a real secret room, but in case you are wondering: the room in the middle
  contains a plasma gun and a blue armorvest.

E3M9: WARRENS

+ This level is very similar to E3M1, but is much more difficult.
# Just like in Hell Keep, there is a rocket launcher just in the west of the
  small grey chamber <0xfd20a96c,0x76057af> in the NW.  This rocket
  launcher is not available on Ultra-Violence mode and above.
+ Note that many of the hidden rooms full of enemies (the rooms that open when
  you go over the transporter-lookalike in the NW) contain weapons and other
  goodies.  Most beneficial of those is the BFG9000 in the SW corner of the
  lake (west behind the entrance).

Level 30: Icon of Sin
  The only secret here is how to complete the level.  At the south end
  of the final room is a switch which raises the platform in the lava
  to the north (with the box of rockets).  Hit the switch and wait for
  the platform to go up.  Then go to the platform, hit space to lower
  it, and get on.  Just before it gets to the top, shoot a rocket into
  the exposed brain of the demon.  Then jump down and lower the
  platform again.  This takes about three tries.

*10-2-2-2*: Secrets in Detail
-----------------------------

All the official secret areas in the game are numbered and listed below,
along with the sector number, IDMYPOS coordinates, and decimal coordinates.
"Official" secrets are those which are counted towards the "Secrets" total
on the end level screen.  Some non-secret areas which are hard to find
are also listed, but are not numbered.

Level 1: Entryway
 1  41 < 8b00000,13700000> ( 2224,  4976)
  In the northernmost room, you see two switches; a near one on your
  right, and a far one on your left.  The one on the right opens a
  small area to the northeast with some armor and health.  Hit the
  right switch before the left one, since the left one makes the right
  one go away.  (Although if you stand in the right place and hit the space
  bar, you can still open the secret door, even if the switch is gone.)
 2   8 < 67c0000, bd80000> ( 1660,  3032)
 3  17 < 9b80000, a0c0000> ( 2488,  2572)
 4  57 < 9a10000, f800000> ( 2465,  3968)
  In the center room (just south of the exit), there is a lift to the
  west.  Go up the lift and hit space on the wall to the west,
  revealing a few imps and a switch (#2) which opens a door leading
  outside in the southeast corner of the center room.  Outside (#3)
  are some imps and a shotgun.  Once you hit the switch at the top of
  the lift, jump down onto the platform just east of the lift.  This
  will open a room with a rocket launcher to the north and east (#4).
 5  28 < b4e0000, ba60000> ( 2894,  2982)
  A room with two imps and a stimpack, behind a hidden door on the
  south side of the east wall of the center room.

Level 2: Underhalls
 1  20 < a4c0000, 87b0000> ( 2636,  2171)
  Just southwest of the red keycard (at the top of the steps) lies a room
  with blue armor.  There is also a teleporter back to the beginning.

Level 3: The Gantlet
 1   5 < da00000, ac90000> ( 3488,  2761)
  In the main room, south of the two sets of stairs and the rocket
  launcher, is a small outcropping with a ledge.  You can make it over
  the ledge if you run southeast at the right angle from the raised
  area west of the stairs.  Try standing at <b8cf79f,e2495ca> at angle
  dbf00000 (or thereabouts) and running straight forward.  Once you
  make it, walk through the south wall to a small room (#1),
  containing a supercharger and partial invisibility.  There is also a
  teleporter to the tower with the rocket launcher.

Level 4: The Focus
 1  15 <fdca0000, 4890000> ( -566,  1161)
  The hallway south of the starting point leads to a staircase, then
  curves east to a door.  On the left side of the corridor are some
  windows into rooms containing armor and lots of sargeants.  Near the
  east end of the corridor, there is a hidden door on the north wall,
  just to the right of the window, which lets you into the south
  windowed room (#1), and from there to the north windowed room.
 2  14 <fe020000, 34b0000> ( -510,   843)
  On the way to the blue key is a room with a lava pool in the
  northwest.  Jump in the pool; there is a secret door to the north,
  leading to a room (#2) containing a double-barreled shotgun.
 3  43 <ff9f0000, 6250000> (  -97,  1573)
  Once you get the red key, walk east off the platform.  There is a
  teleporter there, which takes you to the area just south of the
  staircase mentioned above.

Level 5: The Waste Tunnels
 1 139 < 6840000, 1c00000> ( 1668,   448)
  Just behind the supercharger in the north area of the map (not the
  one at the start) is a small room with a beserker.
 2   3 < 3510000, 1ad0000> (  849,   429)
  Starting in the room with the blue key (the one with red doors at
  the west and east ends), walk north through the window and press
  space on the north wall.  Then run north until you're in the room
  with the plasma gun.
 3  52 < 1800000,fa440000> (  384, -1468)
  On either side of the exit are doors to a room containing some ammo.
  Jump down from one of the ledges on the west or east sides of the
  room.

Level 6: The Crusher
 1  98 < 4200000, 2600000> ( 1056,   608)
  Of the two southernmost pillars in the room just west of the starting
  point, the eastern one contains a secret.  Hit space on its north or
  east wall to lower it, revealing a megasphere.
 2 124 < 24e0000, 1130000> (  590,   275)
  The poison river in the room with the blue keycard leads southeast to
  a room with a teleporter, which takes you to the staircase just east
  of the plasma rifle.
 3 146 <ff420000, 7520000> ( -190,  1874)
  In the northwest corner of the room with the spiral staircase is a
  little outcropping with a few chaingun sargeants.  You can jump into
  it from higher up on the staircase.  (Don't try jumping straight
  west; you need to jump a little bit north, too.  Try running
  straight ahead from <1698256,70dce25> at angle <6d480000>.)  In the
  middle of its west wall is a door leading to a secret room with lots
  of cool stuff, including a megasphere.

 Also: the blue door north of the starting room leads to a lift.  After
 lowering the lift, you will see a little room to the south of the
 lift with some armor.

Level 7: Dead Simple
 1   1 <fda00000,ff600000> ( -608,  -160)
  The platform around the end-level switch in the center.  Kinda hard to
  avoid, unless you're playing deathmatch, in which case there is another
  end-level switch (along with a BFG9000) in the northwest corner of the map.
  There is no way into that room from the outside, so you can't enter it in
  single player.  There is a deathmatch start in there, however, and you
  can open the door from the inside.

Level 8: Tricks and Traps
 1   6 < f200000, 74c0000> ( 3872,  1868)
 2 125 < f200000, ae40000> ( 3872,  2788)
 3  12 <10550000, 9200000> ( 4181,  2336)
 4   9 <102c0000, a290000> ( 4140,  2601)
  Through the door east of the starting point is a room with three
  teleporters; two obvious ones to the left and right, and a third one
  in the center which you can get to by shooting the lion.  All three
  take you to a small octagonal room with a pillar in the center.  The
  left, right, and center teleporters take you to the north, south,
  and east ends of the room, respectively.  Shoot the north and south
  sides of the pillar to open up secret doors behind the teleport
  exits, revealing some ammo (#1), and a chaingun (#2); unfortunately,
  it also reveals some pain elementals, so you can decide for yourself
  if it's worth the trouble.  From the east end of the room (which is
  secret #3), if you jump west over the slime to the center of the
  room, a door will open up in the northeast corner of the room.
  Actually, hitting space on the door will have the same effect.  This
  door (#4) leads to two radiation suits, ammo, partial invisibility,
  and a teleporter back to the octagonal room.
 5  57 < 2f40000, 9500000> (  756,  2384)
  Through the door southwest of the starting point is a cacodemon and a
  chainsaw.  As you take the chainsaw, a door will open up revealing a
  little more of the passageway (#5), containing some ammo and green
  armor, as well as a baron, who will teleport to the east to block
  your exit.
 6 100 < bc00000,10320000> ( 3008,  4146)
 7  98 < ea40000,11400000> ( 3748,  4416)
  In the room with way too many demons are two switches on the south side.
  The west one opens a door on the north wall leading to another door.
  If you have hit the switch in the room with all the cacodemons, then
  this door will be open, leading to a room (#6) with even more demons
  (though you won't see them at first; some doors open after you pass
  by them).  There is a candle on the east side of it, marking a door
  which you can shoot open to reveal the BFG9000 (#7).

Level 9: The Pit
 1 109 <fc600000, 2600000> ( -928,   608)
 2 118 <fd070000, 3050000> ( -761,   773)
  West of the starting point is a corridor leading to the supercharger.
  Once you get it, one of the corridor walls will open up, revealing a
  doom containing a rocket launcher and two rockets.  You can try to
  jump for the launcher, or you can just walk off the northeast edge of
  the platform on the southwest corner of the room; the floor will
  raise up so you can easily get the launcher (#1).  Once you do,
  some doors to the north and east will open up, revealing some sargeants.
  If you try to walk onto the platform with the rockets (#2), some doors
  will open up behind you revealing a wall of chaingunners, who will
  probably negate whatever benefit the supercharger gave you.  :-)
 3  16 < 5c00000, 6db0000> ( 1472,  1755)
 4  17 < 5ac0000, 6c00000> ( 1452,  1728)
 5  22 < 5840000, 6ec0000> ( 1412,  1772)
  On the east side of the map is a room with a hexagonal structure with
  imps and sargeants firing down at you.  If you walk up to the structure,
  the ledge that the bad guys are standing on will lower you, allowing
  you to walk up onto it (#3).  On the north side of the structure is
  a door leading to interior of the structure (#4), which is crammed
  with imps and lost souls.  Opposite the door, and a bit to the right,
  is a hidden door leading to the BFG9000 (#5).
 6  43 < 2d50000, c950000> (  725,  3221)
  In the northeast corner of the map is a spiral staircase of sorts, a
  large, circular series of steps that lower as you walk up to them.
  If you make it all the way up the staircase (clockwise), you can jump
  down to an area with ammo, a supercharger, blue armor, beserk, and
  a teleporter back to your starting point.

Level 10: Refueling Base
 1 114 <fda20000, 2480000> ( -606,   584)
 2 111 <fda00000, 1380000> ( -608,   312)
 3 112 <ff200000, 2800000> ( -224,   640)
 4 116 <fc260000, 2800000> ( -986,   640)
  The round skylit room south of the starting point has four big brown
  pillars, each of which contains a secret area.  These pillars open
  when you enter the room from various directions.  When you enter
  from the south, the center (#1) and south (#2) pillars open doors
  facing each other; they contain health and various monsters.  The
  south one contains a radiation suit, which can come in handy, since
  all these secret areas have acid floors.  When you enter from the
  west, the east pillar opens, revealing health, ammo, and various
  monsters, which may include a pain elemental or two (#3).  When you
  enter from the east, the west pillar opens, revealing the same sort
  of thing (#4).
 5   5 < 5c00000, 8c40000> ( 1472,  2244)
 6  12 < 3c60000, 7000000> (  966,  1792)

 8 180 <f8b00000,f9600000> (-1872, -1696)
 9  34 < 57a0000, 5400000> ( 1402,  1344)
10  49 < 37d0000, 4d50000> (  893,  1237)
11  80 < 6400000, 3480000> ( 1600,   840)
  In the northeast corner of the map is a room with a lot of sargeants
  and former humans.  There are a lot of small niches in this room;
  several of them have secret doors behind them which you can shoot
  open.  You can usually identify them by the fact that they have the
  large white UAC logo on them, rather than the small gray ones.
  There are five such secret doors; behind them, you can find a
  supercharger (#5); light amplification and 200% armor (#6); health,
  armor, demons, a backpack, and a teleporter (#7) (the teleporter,
  which is behind the door at the end of the hidden hallway, takes you
  to room in the southwest (#8), with a invulnerability and an ammo
  box, just west of the room with the cyberdemon); an energy pack
  (#9); and armor, a beserker, ammo, and various monsters (#10).  Also,
  the switch in the southeast corner of the room opens a door to a
  hidden hallway (#11) which leads to the room with all the
  arachnotrons.
12  74 < 7a50000,fbbd0000> ( 1957, -1091)
13  71 < 6840000,fc000000> ( 1668, -1024)
  In the southeast corner of the arachnotron/revenant room is a secret
  door to a hallway (#12) leading south; it contains light amplification
  goggles.  The secret door you emerge from is marked with green pillars.
  Up the steps to your north is another secret door, also marked
  with green pillars; it contains armor, beserk, and ammo (#13).
14 101 <  600000,fffb0000> (   96,    -5)
15  59 <  1c0000,fcc00000> (   28,  -832)
  In the room with the rocket launcher on the pedestal, northwest of
  the room with secret door #13, you can run past the rocket launcher and
  get onto the north ledge with the imps on it (#14).  There is some
  health and green armor up there.  The ledge on the south side of the
  room is actually a lift, which you can lower by hitting space.
  There are two boxes of rockets up there (#15).
16 120 <f8e00000, 4f00000> (-1824,  1264)
17 121 <f8e00000, 4e00000> (-1824,  1248)
18 122 <f8e00000, 4e00000> (-1824,  1248)
  In the northwest, there is a room with two acid floor areas and
  some pillars with stuff hidden behind them.  On the southwest wall,
  there is a section of wall with mismatched texture; when you
  walk near that section of wall, a door opens in the northwest
  acid pool.  The door leads to a megasphere, which counts as
  three secrets (#16, #17, #18).

  Also note that just southeast of your starting point is a secret
  door to a room with some goodies, but it's not an official secret.

Level 11: 'O' of Destruction!
 1  28 < 6600000, 3240000> ( 1632,   804)
  On the east side of the map is a small room containing a chaingun
  with green torches on either side; you get to it via a lift which
  lowers when you come down a set of stairs.  On the south side of
  this room is a secret door, which opens onto a hallway (#1) which
  leads to a ledge where you can get partial invisibility.  Also, note
  that there is a supercharger west of the set of stairs mentioned
  above, on the left (south) side of the door.  Just walk through the wall
  to the right of the green torch.
 2  75 < 67e0000, 71f0000> ( 1662,  1823)
  On the east side of the outer part of the circle (north of the
  walkway leading east, south of the outcropping with the supercharger
  on it) is a hidden door in the slime.  It opens when you cross the
  trigger that reveals the arch-vile.  The door leads to some boxes of
  rockets (#2) and a teleporter which takes you to some energy packs
  in the center of the circle.
 3 114 <ff480000, 9fc0000> ( -184,  2556)
  In the northwest corner of the map is a series of bars which open
  automatically when you approach.  Just north of the bars is a secret
  door (#3) leading west to the hell knight and invulnerability.

Level 12: The Factory
 1  26 <fd950000, 3000000> ( -619,   768)
  In the northwest corner of the big main building is a room with
  jagged walls (#1); it contains a BFG9000 and lots of chaingunners.
  To open the door leading there, you must hit the switch in the
  southeast corner of the room with the blue door facing northwest.
  Note that there is a radiation suit in the southwest corner of
  that room.
 2  85 < 3040000, 2c00000> (  772,   704)
  The room with the blue door facing northeast (with the platforms
  that lower as you reach them) contains a teleporter to a ledge
  facing northeast outside the building.  From there, you can jump
  down to the southwest and get three boxes of ammo (#2).  Hopefully
  you already killed the mancubus.  This room also contains a switch
  which helps you get secret #4.
 3 155 <fef80000,fc730000> ( -264,  -909)
 4 122 <ffa00000, 1200000> (  -96,   288)
  In the southwest corner of the map is a small building with some
  crates.  High on the east wall are a chaingun and some ammo (#3);
  you can get to them by stepping from crate to crate until you
  get to the lift (the switch), and then use the lift to get up
  to ledge they're on.  In the southwest corner of the room is
  a teleporter which takes you to the square structure in the center
  of the big main building.  If you hit the switch mentioned in #2
  already, then the center of this structure will be raised up so
  that you can just grab the supercharger (#4).  If you haven't,
  then you'll be surrounded by four imps scratching away at you.
  Kill them and hit the switch, which will raise the floor up so
  you can get the supercharger.

Level 13: Downtown
 1   3 < 5000000,f68b0000> ( 1280, -2421)
  There is a building in the southeast with a switch next to a
  lift.  Hit the switch and take the lift up.  There are two
  doors; the right door won't open.  Take the left one and jump
  across the slime pit to the other side (#1); there's a computer
  map and a chaingun.
 2  74 <fcb00000,f2de0000> ( -848, -3362)
 3  11 < 2e00000,f3d00000> (  736, -3120)
  In the southwest corner of the building in the southwest corner of
  the map is a switch which opens a door leading outside.  There's
  a medikit and some ammo out there (#2).  Just to the east of
  the switch is a stack of crates which you can lower by hitting
  the space bar, revealing another switch.  After you hit the
  switch, you can walk around the stack of crates to your north
  to find a set of stairs leading up to a teleporter.  The teleporter
  takes you to a ledge just west of the starting point (#3).  From
  this ledge, you can run north into the building with the
  supercharger.
 4 108 <fd200000,f7680000> ( -736, -2200)
  The building in the southwest corner of the map has a pit in the
  northwest corner, which leads to a lift.  The lift takes you up
  into another building.  Just across from the lift (to the east)
  is a switch; hitting the switch opens a door revealing some
  shotgun shells (#4).
 5 128 <ffb80000,f7780000> (  -72, -2184)
  The building with the revenants guarding it (the one with the
  blue door at the entrance) contains a crate with a switch on
  the north side.  You can hit the switch to lower the northeast
  platform, so you can get the chainsaw (#5).
 6 166 < 2400000,  d20000> (  576,   210)
  The structure with the red keycard on top of it has a hidden door
  in the middle of the north wall, which can be reached from the
  ground.  The door opens to reveal some blue armor (#6).
 7 213 <ff400000,   40000> ( -192,     4)
  In the northeast corner of the map is a teleporter which takes
  you to the ledge of a building with some imps.  Jump over to
  the ledge of the building just to the west.  There's a door
  there which leads to a teleporter, which takes you to the
  interior of a building farther north, right between two cacodemons
  (#7).  There's a lot of ammo in there too.  Hit space on the inner
  wall to get out.
 8 223 <ffc20000,fc6f0000> (  -62,  -913)
  The building just southeast of the crusher with the plasma gun has a
  door in the south wall with a stairway leading up to a blue door.
  Once you have the blue key, you can enter out and get some ammo and
  rockets (#8).

Level 14: The Inmost Dens
  No official secrets.  One way to get the supercharger is to go to
  the building east of the starting building via the bridge.  Enter
  the building through the south door.  Run out one of the windows
  facing west into the moat, south of the bridge.  Lower the lift
  in the southwest corner, then go through, and go east, kill the
  arachnotron, and get the supercharger.

Level 15: Industrial Zone
 1 290 < 11c0000,  600000> (  284,    96)
  Get the red card key.  Then jump down to the ground, just to the
  east of the platform the red key is on.  There is a beserk box there.
  Hit the space bar on the crate just to your east to lower it, and
  get the stimpack (#1).
 2 276 <fd880000,ff500000> ( -632,  -176)
  Take the teleporter in the southeast corner of the red card key building.
  Walk out onto the ledge, then go to the north end and drop into the
  opening to the west, falling down to the main floor of the building.
  Then walk out the west exit.  Go back and take the teleporter in the
  red card key building again, and walk north and west again; this time,
  the floor has risen up to the level of the ledge on the north side
  of the building.  From here you can jump south onto the platform with
  the ammo and chaingun (#2).
 3 104 < 4c80000,fc800000> ( 1224,  -896)
  Go to the top of the building northeast of the diamond-shaped building.
  Just north of the teleporter is a secret door on the east wall (#3).
  Go through down onto the acid pool; to the north is a backpack and
  some rockets.
 4  53 < b000000,f5800000> ( 2816, -2688)
  Go to the top of the diamond-shaped building on the north shore of
  the acid lake; walk to the south ledge of the building.  Jump south
  down onto the small island with the radiation suit and energy cells.
  (Try walking instead of running.)  Hit the switch, then jump off and
  go northeast to the east side of the lake.  Go through the door you
  find there; through it, you'll find a platform with an
  invulnerability sphere (#4).
 5  70 < 8100000,f3c80000> ( 2064, -3128)
 6  71 < 8100000,f3880000> ( 2064, -3192)
 7  47 < 7c30000,f5360000> ( 1987, -2762)
 8  21 < 5440000,f1040000> ( 1348, -3836)
  In the southeast corner of the map is a building with a spiral
  staircase.  Go up and around the staircase.  As you turn to go
  south, a door will open to the east.  Run south across the lift,
  then east, then run north, jumping across the lower hallway; there
  you'll find an open door (#5) revealing a megasphere (#6).  Now go
  up the stairway again.  As you go south over the lift, a door will
  open up on the north wall, behind you.  Go through the door into an
  area with energy cells and lost souls (#7).  Go east into a small
  opening with a switch.  Hitting the switch will cause a teleporter
  to appear in the hallway to the west.  Enter the teleporter; it will
  take you to a platform in the southwest corner of the building with
  a chainsaw (#8).
 9 147 <  380000,f1e00000> (   56, -3616)
10 216 <fc970000,f5770000> ( -873, -2697)
11 195 <fce00000,f0340000> ( -800, -4044)
  Go the building in the southwest corner of the map.  At the south
  end, you will find some stairs going east (unless you haven't hit
  the switch to raise them).  At the top of the stairs is a secret
  door to the east, revealing a small area (#9) with a teleporter to
  the top of the square spiral staircase building northwest of the
  diamond-shaped building.  I was not able to get credit for secret
  #9, even if I walked into the teleporter; so the most I could get
  for this level is 90% secrets.  Instead of taking the teleporter,
  you could go to the top of the building to the ledge looking north.
  Hit the switch on the west wall, then jump down to the ground and go
  back through the front door of the building.  Go into the acid river
  and follow it north to the lift, which takes you up to another ledge
  where you'll find a plasma gun and ammo (#10).  Now go back to the
  south end of the building and go south through the acid river
  tunnel.  If you got secret #4, there will be a secret door leading
  south in the tunnel (#11) leading to a teleporter to the secret
  level (level 31).

Level 16: Suburbs
 1  41 < 1c00000,fd180000> (  448,  -744)
 2  33 < 1b80000,fe580000> (  440,  -424)
  There are two buildings in the center of the map.  You start in the
  north one; enter the south one.  In the south part of the building
  is a little platform with some shotgun shells on it.  Hit space to
  lower the platform, then get on it.  When you get to the top, shoot
  at the niche in the wall to your east.  A megasphere will be revealed
  in the southeast corner (#1).  (It's easy not to get credit for this
  secret, even if you do get the megasphere.  Walk slowly into and out
  of that corner, making sure you drop into the depression there.)
  Then turn northwest and shoot at the eyes in the wall.  You may need
  to do this while the platform is rising for it to work, or you could
  try using a shotgun.  If you hit it, a door will open just behind the
  wall to your north, containing some ammo (#2).
 3  13 < 6c90000,  800000> ( 1737,   128)
 4   7 < 5310000,fff80000> ( 1329,    -8)
  On the east side of the map is a building with doors on each wall,
  but you can only go through the door in the east wall.  Open the
  east door and enter the building (#3).  Hit space on the northwest
  platform to lower it, then get on.  When it rises back up, walk
  south into the acid pool inside the southwest platform, then hit the
  switch.  The platform will lower, revealing a small room to the
  northwest.  Inside the room is a BFG9000, some energy packs, and a
  medikit (#4).

Level 17: Tenements
 1  48 <fd400000,f5200000> ( -704, -2784)
  Go to the center of the map, then go east until you come to two
  staircases leading north and south.  Lower the lift to your south by
  jumping down in the slime just to the west of it and hitting the
  switch.  Just south of the lift is a hidden room with some armor.
  On the west wall of this room is a lift (#1) leading to a chaingun.
 2  89 <fa900000,fd380000> (-1392,  -712)
  In the north part of the map is an M-shaped structure.  Walk north
  down the middle of the M into the acid lake, then turn around and
  hit space on the wall.  The middle of the M will be lowered, and you
  will see a switch to your south.  Run south and hit the switch.
  (Actually, you don't have to lower the walkway to hit the switch;
  you just have to stand in the right place and press the space bar.)
  A door will be revealed to the east; you can jump into it and get
  some armor (#2) and a BFG9000.
 3 150 <fb040000,f94c0000> (-1276, -1716)
  On the way to the exit, just to the southwest, is a lift.  As you go
  up the lift, you'll notice an opening to the south.  While the lift
  is moving, run into the opening (#3) and into a hallway leading east
  to a megasphere.

 Also, the room with the really annoying stairway north and west
 of the starting point has four teleporters on the floor.  The
 northwest and southeast ones go to the north and south ledges
 where the monsters appear.

Level 18: The Courtyard
 1  17 <f7f40000, 3f60000> (-2060,  1014)
  When you walk around the pillar in the center of the main area, a
  number of doors will open up, including two against the wall west of
  the center pillar.  Of these two doors, the north one leads to a
  BFG9000 and some more monsters (#1).  (The south one has a hall of
  mirrors effect in the door tracks.)
 2  36 <fa050000,ff050000> (-1531,  -251)
  When you walk counterclockwise around the pillar in the center of
  the main area, a door will open up northeast of the pillar leading
  to a teleporter, which takes you to the platform southwest of the
  pillar.  The platform (#2) contains some rockets, health, and blue
  armor.  The teleporter will not be there until you hit the switch
  on the northeast corner of the plus-shaped structure just to the
  south of it (the one containing the cacodemons).
 3  76 < a300000, 4300000> ( 2608,  1072)
  In the northwest corner of the map, hidden between the structures on
  the north and west walls, is a corner with a small bit of grass.
  Walking into the grass teleports you to the northeast corner of the
  map, on a ledge containing a medical kit and a computer map.  (Note
  that the building just to the east of the bit of grass has an
  unclosed sector inside it; you can see out the east wall.)
 4  74 < 8b00000,  940000> ( 2224,   148)
  In the east area of the map is a hallway ending at a blue wall with
  a skull switch.  Hitting the switch opens a hidden door revealing a
  chaingun (#4).

Level 19: The Citadel
 1  43 <fdc20000,ffe20000> ( -574,   -30)
 2  97 <fd860000, 1a00000> ( -634,   416)
 3  95 <fc360000, 1e60000> ( -970,   486)
 4 100 <fa350000, 5a90000> (-1483,  1449)
 5  85 <f9270000, 73c0000> (-1753,  1852)
 6  33 < 6430000, 5300000> ( 1603,  1328)
 7 126 <fdb70000,fc640000> ( -585,  -924)
  In the southwest corner of the main building is a room with a switch
  in the middle which opens doors leading north and south.  Hit the
  switch and go north.  At the intersection, go west, and north
  through the door into a room with health, partial invisibility, and
  lots of imps (#1).  Then go back to the intersection and go north.
  At one point, you'll meet a hallway leading off to the northwest.
  Just south of this hallway on the west wall is a secret door.  (It's
  just north of the place where it LOOKS like there's a secret door.)
  This door leads through a short hallway (#2) to a lift, which leads
  to a hall leading northwest (#3) and stops at a window.  Jump out
  the window to the northwest.  You should be able to reach the steps
  of the building to the northwest (#4).  The building has two
  openings leading inside.  Try the south one first; when you finish
  in there, an area will open up to the northeast with lots of
  troopers and a computer map (#5).  The north opening leads
  (eventually) to five teleporters.  The middle one leads to the
  pillar in the middle of the castle, which contains a rocket
  launcher.  The other four lead to the four corners of the castle.
  Take the northeast one; in the northeast corner of the castle (#6),
  you will find the BFG9000, some demons, and the blue key.  Or, take
  the southwest one; there you will find a chainsaw and the yellow key
  (#7).  An easier way to get to the southwest tower is to go to the
  southwest room of the castle with the doors on the north and south;
  take the south door, and walk down the corridor until you hear a
  door open, then run back and walk through the open door to your left.
 8  38 <ff200000,ffad0000> ( -224,   -83)
 9  52 < 5400000, 1910000> ( 1344,   401)
  In the southeast corner of the map is an area at the top of some
  steps with two things that look like switches to the north.  They're
  not switches, but there's a hidden door between them.  Go through
  the door and up the steps, and hit the switch you see there (on the
  east side of the wall) 3 times.  Then jump down to the north onto
  the platform you've raised up, and from there jump onto the platform
  in the northeast corner of the room.  Go through the teleporter, and
  you'll get a supercharger (#8).  Go south a bit and then north, and
  you'll be teleported to a platform in the southeast area of the
  castle.  Jump to the platform to the northwest (this platform
  appears when you shoot at the imps in the southwest corner; the room
  that they are in is missing its north wall, BTW) and go through the door,
  then down the steps to get the red skull key and some rockets (#9).

Level 20: Gotcha!
 1  56 < 8360000,ee3e0000> ( 2102, -4546)
  The structure just south of your starting point consists of a building
  with a walkway around it to the south entrance.  (The walkway may not
  be there if you have not tried to get to the structure; just walk south
  from the starting point to raise the walkway.)  In the southwest part
  of the "moat" (the poison area between the walkway and the building) is a
  small opening, containing an energy cell pack and a radiation suit (#1).
  Once you have the radiation suit, you can safely walk around the moat
  to the other side, where there is a teleporter leading back to your
  starting point.
 2   4 < ece0000,f5ff0000> ( 3790, -2561)
  At the top of the structure on the east side of the map is a
  teleporter.  (To get there, jump down into the slime just east of
  your starting point and walk north through the little door, up the
  steps (shoot the wall that's in your way), and jump down from the
  window.  Then hit the switch to lower the lift to the entrance of
  the structure, and fight your way up to the top.)  The teleporter
  takes you back to the starting point.  Just to the left of the
  teleporter is a hidden door which takes you through a small room
  (#2) with another teleporter, which goes to a tower on the north
  side of the structure.  In all likelihood, you'll teleport right on
  top of a pain elemental, killing it before it has a chance to fire
  any of those damn skulls.
 3 101 < 5200000,fbf00000> ( 1312, -1040)
  There are two towers west and east of the circular area to the north
  of the main building.  There's nothing on the east one, but the west
  one (#3) has a megasphere on it.  To get there, take the big demon
  teleporter in the circular area.  Walk down the stairs and kill the
  bad guys.  (Note that just south of the stairs, down in the slime,
  is a teleporter leading to the area where the cacodemon was hiding.
  There's blue armor and some health up there.)  Then jump across to
  the dark area east of the stairs.  Instead of walking south to the
  green armor, find the hidden path leading northeast in the dark to
  the teleporter, which takes you to the megasphere.
 4 127 < 2600000,ff180000> (  608,  -232)
 5 132 < 2210000,ff1c0000> (  545,  -228)
 6 128 < 29e0000,ff1c0000> (  670,  -228)
  The structure west of the circular area to the north of the main
  building (not #3--the thing to the northwest of it) has a
  supercharger (#4) and a BFG9000 in it.  To get there, grab a
  radiation suit if you have one, and walk northeast through the slime
  to the building with the teleporter to #3.  Walk around the
  southeast corner of the building, looking for a staircase; there
  should be some flaming skulls there to mark the place.  Walk up the
  stairs to the teleporter, which takes you to the structure to the
  west.  Hit the switch to raise the platform, and kill all the bad
  guys.  If you don't see the BFG9000, shoot your pistol out the east
  window at the big demon teleporter, and a door behind you should
  open revealing the BFG and some ammo.  Then hit the switch on the
  south side of the room to reveal the supercharger (#4).
  Unfortunately, there's a teleporter in the way, which takes you back
  to the demon teleporter; fortunately, there are two secret doors to
  the left and right of the teleporter, which you can take to get to
  the supercharger (through another secret door to its west or east).
  The left one has an arch-vile in it (#5), so I suggest you take the
  right one, which contains an energy cell (#6), unless you want 100%
  kills and secrets; but if you didn't, why would you be reading this?
 7  59 < 6730000,f1270000> ( 1651, -3801)
  In the room with a staircase leading to a plasma gun, there is a
  secret door on the south wall, leading to a small room (#7) with a
  supercharger on the west end.

Level 21: Nirvana
  No official secrets.  To get the megasphere, hit the switch next to
  the teleporter which takes you to the room it's in, then jump in the
  teleporter and run and get it.  Note that the room with the
  arrow-shaped staircase has some weird effects on the ceiling.

Level 22: The Catacombs
 1  85 <fd200000,  f50000> ( -736,   245)
  In the northwest corner of the starting room is a hidden door leading
  to a room with rockets, a supercharger, armor, and a spectre.
 2 125 <fd300000,ff000000> ( -720,  -256)
  In the southwest corner of the starting room is a hidden door which
  leads through a short hallway (#2) to the room you can see to your
  south, containing the plasma gun and an army of chaingunners.
  To open the door, hit space on the green torch.
 3  14 < 3340000, 3a00000> (  820,   928)
  A bit northeast of the red skull key is a secret door leading to a
  small opening (#3) with a teleporter, which takes you to the room south
  of your starting point which contains a plasma gun, in case you hadn't
  already gotten it.

Level 23: Barrels O' Fun
 1  61 <  600000, a700000> (   96,  2672)
  Between the two north-south hallways which lead outside is a third
  hallway containing a megasphere and two boxes of rockets.  It has
  a little outcropping just north of it which you can jump down onto,
  and then walk south to get the goodies.
 2  11 < 81c0000, b780000> ( 2076,  2936)
  In the northeast part of the map are two hallways with boxes and
  boxes of rockets, for use against the various spiders.  In the south
  hallway is a door to the north, leading to a supercharger (#2).

Level 24: The Chasm
 1  98 <ff000000,f8540000> ( -256, -1964)
 2 116 < 1000000,f6870000> (  256, -2425)
  Your starting point is located in a small opening in the north side
  of a building.  The main entrance to the building is around the
  walkway a short distance to the east, but you can't get in, because
  the entrance is too steep.  To raise the stairs up, first fall into
  any of the teleporters in the slime on the floor of the southeast
  corner of the map, north and south of the building you're trying to
  get into.  You should appear south of a series of tower.  Jump down
  from tower to tower, working your way east to a small area with a
  teleporter.  That will take you to another teleporter.  Go straight
  (east) and hit all the switches in that area.  That should raise the
  stairs at the main entrance of the building, so get back there by
  going back to the teleporter, and go through it to the teleporter at
  the base of the series of towers.  Then run west to the teleporter
  on the acid floor.  That will take you back up to the south tower,
  so run northwest to get back to the building near the starting
  point.  Once you get inside (#1), you'll see three things sticking
  out of the north wall.  Hit space on the first one you come to; it
  will lower a lift to your south, which leads to a small area with
  some ammo (#2).
 3  62 <f5400000,fec00000> (-2752,  -320)
  This is the invulnerability in the west part of the map, which is
  not that hard to find; just follow the annoyingly thin walkway west.
  You can jump down onto it, but then you'll be stuck there; you'll
  have to get off that platform and wait for the floor to rise up,
  then walk to one of the surrounding walls, and hit space until you
  get back up to the level of the walkway.  At that point, the
  invulnerability will have worn off.  A better idea is to get a
  radiation suit and jump down into the moat around it, and then hit
  space on the surrounding walls until it reaches the level of the
  platform the sphere is sitting on, then grab it; then the floor will
  raise up to the level of the surrounding walls, and you can get out.
  Or you can try jumping down just to the left or right of the
  invulnerability sphere, enough to get the floor to raise up and take
  away the poison; then grab the sphere, and hit space a few more
  times to get back to the walkway.
 4 123 <fda00000,f1d00000> ( -608, -3632)
  The south area of the map has a shotgun with a small walkway to its
  south.  If you get the shotgun, an opening will appear to the south
  revealing some monsters.  After killing the monsters, you can jump
  down into the opening to get some ammo and health (#4).  When you
  jump back, the floor around the shotgun will rise up and become
  non-toxic.

Level 25: Bloodfalls
 There are no official secrets, but there are some hidden areas.  In
 the north-south hallway with two windows on each side of the hallway,
 in the north part of the map, there is a secret door between the two
 windows on the east side, leading to a rocket launcher and some ammo.
 In the south part of the map, in the room with some steps leading
 south between two windows, there is a hidden room in the northeast
 with a BFG9000; it's on the automap.

Level 26: The Abandoned Mines
 1  29 <  e00000,ffb80000> (  224,   -72)
  When you start the level, there's a secret door right behind you
  (#1) which leads to a big room with lots of bad guys and items.
  The teleporter on the acid floor in the west area of the room
  takes you to a platform where you can jump and get the plasma gun.
 2  34 < 16c0000,  200000> (  364,    32)
  When you start the level, there's a secret door right to the east
  of you (#2).  Hit the switch to lower the room first, then hit space
  on the south part of the east wall.  This door leads to a network
  of tunnels that take you to many of the acid-floored rooms and
  monster ledges that you see from your starting point.
 3  98 <f8380000, 3a00000> (-1992,   928)
 4 121 <fb6c0000, 4e00000> (-1172,  1248)
  The blue keycard has a secret door behind it (#3) revealing a switch
  that lowers two lifts, revealing two areas to the north and south of
  the acid pool to your east, which contain some cacodemons.  The south
  area contains a trigger line that raises the floor near the east door,
  and a switch which opens that door.  The north area contains blue
  armor, and a secret door on the east wall (#4) leading to some
  health potions and a supercharger.

Level 27: Monster Condo
 1  10 <fb5c0000,fea50000> (-1188,  -347)
  When you start the level, the first thing you should do is go through
  the door in the northwest corner of the room (across the acid pool)
  and go west to the lit area with the ammo (#1).  You have 30 seconds
  after the level begins before this area is closed off.
 2 177 < 5f60000,fdad0000> ( 1526,  -595)
 3 171 < 6400000,fbe00000> ( 1600, -1056)
  East of the acid pool with the rocket launcher in the center
  is a west-east dividing wall.  On the east wall, north of the
  dividing wall, is a lit area in the corner.  When you walk into
  this lit area, a door opens to the east revealing an area (#2)
  containing partial invisibility, light amplification, energy
  cells, and lots of monsters.  South of the dividing wall is
  another lit area along the east wall.  When you walk into it,
  a door opens to the east revealing an area (#3) containing some
  ammo, health, shotgun shells, and arachnotrons.
 4  92 < 12d0000, 2f60000> (  301,   758)
 5  93 < 1200000, 4e00000> (  288,  1248)
  In the northeast room with the impaled bodies everywhere, there are
  two switches to the north.  The east one lowers a lift to the
  southwest, which leads to a long corridor of health potions (#4) and
  a teleporter (#5) which takes you up to the ledge in the northeast
  corner of the room, where there's health, armor, ammo, and a BFG.  I
  don't think it's possible to get #5, since the teleporter's sector
  is secret, and you can never enter that sector, because there's the
  teleport line is in the way.  Also note that you can't get out of
  the ledge in the northeast corner unless the door to it has opened
  up already.
 6  45 <f95d0000, 5000000> (-1699,  1280)
 7 129 <f7bd0000,fc400000> (-2115,  -960)
  There are two long north-south skylit rooms with large teleporters
  in the center and pictures of a demon on the north wall.  Each one
  has a switch on the east wall, which you can use to open up the west
  wall in both rooms, revealing some mancubi, a beserk sphere, a
  supercharger, and a computer map in each room (#6 in the north one,
  #7 in the south one).
 8 157 < 4e00000,f7600000> ( 1248, -2208)
  This is the room with the hell knight, just southwest of the
  yellow key, which has the switch that lets you out of the room
  after you get the yellow key.

Level 28: The Spirit World
 1  54 < 3e00000,f1a00000> (  992, -3680)
 2  55 < 5b00000,f1a00000> ( 1456, -3680)
  In the south part of the map is a room with five columns and a
  throne.  Walk up to the throne to lower the middle column, and then
  go stand on it (#1).  (You need to do this in order to complete the
  level, so I don't see why it's a secret.)  When the column raises up
  again, you will see two switches to the north and south.  The south
  one reveals the yellow key.  The north one reveals a passage beyond
  the yellow key, as well as four hell knights, an arch-vile, and
  (fortunately) an invulnerability sphere, some rockets, and a
  teleporter which takes you to the ledge on the east side of the room
  (#2), where you can get another invulnerability sphere and a
  megasphere.
 3  17 <fdc80000,f3c00000> ( -568, -3136)
 4   3 <fea80000,f5a00000> ( -344, -2656)
  In the southwest part of the map is a hallway which leads west and
  then north.  At the bend in the hallway is a small niche to the
  south containing an arachnotron, who will come out and attack you.
  To enter the niche (#3), just walk through the south wall.  There is
  also another niche farther north containing some chaingunners and
  troopers, as well as ammo and health (#4).  Just walk through the
  east wall.
 5  88 < 4240000,ff440000> ( 1060,  -188)
 6  92 < 6440000,  840000> ( 1604,   132)
 7  93 < 6440000, 3dc0000> ( 1604,   988)
  In the northeast part of the map is a room with five columns.  As
  soon as you enter, some hidden doors will open up and lots of
  monsters will come out.  As soon as you kill all the monsters, look
  on the automap, and you will see three secret doors in the niches
  where the monsters were.  The southwest niche has a secret door
  leading east to a supercharger (#5).  The southeast niche has a
  secret door leading north to four backpacks, a medikit, and a
  revenant (#6).  The northeast niche has a secret door leading east
  to a mancubus and a beserker (#7).

Level 29: The Living End
  No official secrets.

  Northwest of your starting point is a path which leads west to a
  teleporter.  As you approach the teleporter, some windows open to
  the north exposing some chaingunners, who promptly attack you.  If
  you walk north off the ledge and then walk west around the structure
  the chaingunners are in, you'll see a small opening leading to a
  teleporter.  This takes you to the ledge the chaingunners are on;
  there's a plasma gun there.

Level 30: Icon of Sin
  The only secret here is how to complete the level.  At the south end
  of the final room is a switch which raises the platform in the lava
  to the north (with the box of rockets).  Hit the switch and wait for
  the platform to go up.  Then go to the platform, hit space to lower
  it, and get on.  Just before it gets to the top, shoot a rocket into
  the exposed brain of the demon.  Then jump down and lower the
  platform again.  This takes about three tries.

Level 31: Wolfenstein
  No official secrets.  However, the room just before the exit door
  has a secret door in the southwest corner, which leads to a small
  niche with a medikit.  The west wall of this niche has another
  secret door which leads to a second exit door; this goes to the
  super-secret level (level 32).  Just south and a bit east of the
  second exit door is a secret door which reveals a supercharger.

Level 32: Grosse
  No official secrets.  However, in the middle of the east wall (the
  middle Swastika) is a hidden door which reveals an invulnerability
  sphere.  The west wall has a hidden door in the same place, leading
  to a bunch of medikits, and a plasma gun with lots of energy cells.
  Also, the two northernmost and two southernmost pillars contain
  various weapons, and a megasphere; walk up to them and hit the space
  bar.

[10-3]: When should I use each weapon?
======================================
FIST:  Never use unless you have Berserk.  This is really cool, but not as
good as the chain saw.

CHAIN SAW:  Good for tight corners.  Rips apart the Demons and Spectres.
This is probably the best weapon for non-shooting enemies.  The chain saw
also works wonders on Cacodemons.  They turn away when you start to chop
them, and cannot fire.

PISTOL:  Average weapon.  Does damage to the Former Humans, but the shotgun is
preferred.  Only to be used when in dire need of ammo.

SHOTGUN:  This is probably the best all around weapon.  Use this much of
the time as it is very powerful.  Its only problem is that its rapid fire
is not very fast.  Very useful in "mazes" where enemies are very close but
not in large amounts.

SUPER SHOTGUN:  Only found in DOOM II, shotgun gurus will love this one.  
Double the power, but uses double the ammo.  Great for taking out those 
hard to kill enemies or many enemies in a group.

CHAINGUN:  This weapon takes a fair amount of time to kill enemies.  Good
for a lot of monsters in a row.  Also very useful for Imps and Cacodemons,
because the chain gun can keep them from firing back.

ROCKET LAUNCHER:  Good for occasional long shots at many enemies in one
place.  Be careful, however, this weapon can hurt you as well if the
rocket bursts at close range.  Very useful in DeathMatch mode. :)

PLASMA RIFLE:  Rapid fires very quickly.  Hurts some enemies a lot, and
others not as much.  Tends to block the view, which is very dangerous when
you have a large amount of enemies coming toward you.

BFG9000:  The most powerful weapon.  Kills almost ANY enemy in one shot,
but uses a lot of energy cells and rapid fire is very slow.

[10-4]: Where can I get each weapon for the first time?
=======================================================
        Here is a chart that shows on which level in each episode you can
pick up each weapon.  This chart is for DOOM I.

                .-----------------------------------.
                | Weapon          | E1M | E2M | E3M |
                |-----------------------------------|
                | Chain saw       |  2  |  2  |  5  |
                | Shotgun +       |  1  |  1  |  1  |
                | Chain gun       |  2  |  2  |  2  |
                | Rocket launcher |  3  |  2  |  1  |
                | Plasma gun      |  -  |  1  |  2  |
                | BFG9000         |  -  |  -  |  3  |
                `-----------------------------------'
        +: Can also be picked up from the first dead sergeant.

[10-5]: Where can I find the various powerups in the game?
==========================================================
        These charts outline where all of the powerups may be found in the
game.  This chart is for Ultra-Violence, single-player mode only.

Note:  This chart pertains to direct hits only.  Missed shots increase the
       amount of ammunition required to kill any enemy.
       The last three columns relate to missiles fired by monsters.  Imps and
       Lost Souls do the same damage as single bullets.

*: Monster only found in DOOM II.

+: This regards a player at 100% strength.  Again, missed shots increase the
   amount.

(10-9): Which enemies will attack each other?
=============================================
        Projectile monster attacks do not hurt other monsters of the same
species. For example, Imp fireballs do not hurt other Imps, but do hurt
other monsters.  Baron green plasma does not hurt other barons, Cacodemon
gasballs don't hurt other Cacodemons, and Cyberdemons are immune to their own
rockets.
        Bullet attacks are fair game for all.  Troopers, Sergeants, and
Spiderdemons all kill their own kind cheerfully.
        Scratching and biting attacks are hard to misdirect but it does
happen, and when it does, Demons will happily go after each other, as will
Spectres.

examples are cheating utilities, map editors, and sound editors.  This
software is in no way endorsed by id, and neither id Software nor myself
take any responsibility for any problems you have with this software.  DO
NOT contact id regarding any of this software.  Most of this software will
not work on the shareware version of DOOM, by request from id Software.

DESCRIPTION:
        With VERDA, you can move THINGs around the map and change them
to other things. You can change LINE triggers, SIDE image selection,
SECTOR image selection, floor heights, ceiling heights, sector actions
(raising/lowering, etc.), and properties (acid/blinking lights, etc.)  You
can graphically see which lines trigger which sectors, and change this.
You can display the NODE information graphically, but it cannot currently
be edited.

Tools will let you do any number of operations on the resources in
the WAD file. You can view it in hex mode, or if it's a graphic
resource, you can view it in 320x200x256 VGA mode.  You can also
export it to a file (an LBM if it's a graphic resource), or replace
it by importing a file.  And, if you're really brave, you can export
all the resources in the WAD file to individual files.

     developers integrate new graphics into WAD files.  Deathmatch
     Compilations DM_xx_xx.ZIP; several 9 level episodes containing the
     best deathmatch maps, optimized for use in a single episode (namely:
     DMSMALL1 and DMSMALL2).  Also working on a new solo episode with
     Brant Katkansky, author of NUCLEAR.WAD.  Main area of interest is in
